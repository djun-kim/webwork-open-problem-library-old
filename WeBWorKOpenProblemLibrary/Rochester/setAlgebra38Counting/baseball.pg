There are nine different positions on a baseball team.  If a team has $A 
players how many different line-ups can the team make?
$BR

every inning.  If no game goes to extra innings, and a season consists of $B
games, how many complete seasons can the team play without repeating a line-up?
$BR
The team can play \{ans_rule(10) \} complete seasons without repeating
a line-up.
