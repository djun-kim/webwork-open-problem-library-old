TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Willie Wonka gives everyone who visits his factory $A pieces of candy to take 
home.  He never gives a person 2 or more pieces of the same type of candy.  
If Mr. Wonka has $B different types of candy, in how many different ways could 
Mr. Wonka give a visitor his candy?
$BR
Mr. Wonka can distribute candy in \{ans_rule(20) \} different ways.
$BR
If $C people visit Mr. Wonka's factory each day, how many days could Mr. Wonka go without giving two visitors the same selection
of candy
$BR
Mr. Wonka can go for \{ans_rule(20) \} days without repeating candy selections.
