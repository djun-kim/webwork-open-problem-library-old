TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Farmer Jones, and his wife, Dr. Jones, decide to build a fence in their field,
to keep the sheep safe. Since Dr. Jones is a mathematician, she suggests
building fences described by \(y = $a x^2 \) and \(y = x^2 + $b \). Farmer
Jones thinks this would be much harder than just building an enclosure with
straight sides, but he wants to please his wife. What is the area of the
enclosed region? $BR
