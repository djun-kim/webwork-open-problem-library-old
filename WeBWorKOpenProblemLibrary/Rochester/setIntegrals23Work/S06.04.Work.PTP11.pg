BEGIN_TEXT

A $L foot chain weighs $M pounds and hangs from the ceiling.  Find the
work done in lifting the lower end of the chain to the ceiling so that
it's level with the upper end.  Your answer must include the correct
\{ helpLink('units') \}.   (You may enter
${BITALIC}lbf${EITALIC} or ${BITALIC}lb*ft${EITALIC} for
${BITALIC}ft-lb${EITALIC}.)

$HR
${BBOLD}Hint:${EBOLD} Draw a picture of the chain in its initial and
final positions.  If a link is initially \( x \) feet from the lower
end of the chain, can you find a function that describes how far it
travels to its final position?
