BEGIN_TEXT
Here is a quick review question, concerning trig functions, which you'll need for understanding
a later problem in this section about the growth of a bank account
when the deposits occur periodically.
(In this case periodically means the function describing
the rate of deposit is something
like sin(t) or cos(t) -- it oscillates.
In fact the more precise term is to call
such functions $BBOLD harmonic $EBOLD because the sine and cosine functions describe how
strings and other waves vibrate.)
$PAR
We need some terminolgy to describe such functions.  These terms are all given
on page 190 of Boyce and DiPrima (and probably other textbooks where you have discussed sin() and
cos().  The important terms are $BBOLD frequency $EBOLD, $BBOLD period $EBOLD,
$BBOLD amplitude $EBOLD, and $BBOLD phase shift $EBOLD.  Look them up if you are having trouble.

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
Let \[ y = $a_sign \sqrt {$a} \sin($b \pi t + {$c:%0.4g}e ^{$exp} ) \].
$BR
where t is given in minutes (min)  and y has units of meters (m).
$PAR
What is the amplitude?  \{ ans_rule(15) \} -- give units
$PAR
What is the period?  \{ ans_rule(15) \} -- give units
$PAR
What is the frequency ? \{ ans_rule(15) \}  -- give units
$BR
Hint:  Frequency units  are cycles per min or radians per min or sometimes
revolutions per min.
1 cycles/min = 2pi rad/min = 1 rev/min.
(See \{htmlLink("/docs/docs/pglanguage/help_units.html", "units help") \} for more details.)
$PAR
What is the phase shift?  \{ ans_rule(15) \} -- This is also in radians or in cycles or in revolutions.
$PAR
[NOTE:  If needed, you can enter \(\pi\) as 'pi' in your answers.]
