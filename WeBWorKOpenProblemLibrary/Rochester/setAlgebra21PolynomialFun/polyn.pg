BEGIN_TEXT
A box without a lid is constructed from a $a inch by $a inch piece
of cardboard by cutting \( x\) in. squares from each corner and folding
up the sides.
        $BR
a) Determine the volume of the box as a function of the variable \( x\).
$BR
  \(V(x) =\) \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR
b) Use a graphing calculator to approximate the values of \( x\) that produce a 
volume of $value.
$BR $BBOLD Note: $EBOLD  There are 3 values of \( x\) that produce the given value but
only two of them are acceptable in the context of the problem.
List the two answers, to at least one decimal place,  separated by commas. 
$BR
\( x = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}
