BEGIN_TEXT
A man invests his savings in two accounts, one paying 6 percent and the other
paying 10 percent simple interest per year. He puts twice as much in the 
lower-yielding account because it is less risky. His annual interest is $sum
dollars. 
How much did he invest at each rate?
$BR
Your answer is
$BR
total in the account paying 6 percent interest is  \{ans_rule(25) \}
$BR
total in the account paying 10 percent interest is  \{ans_rule(25) \}
