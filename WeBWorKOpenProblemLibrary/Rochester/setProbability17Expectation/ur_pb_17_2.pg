\( $n \) people arrive separately to a professional dinner. Upon arrival, each person looks to see if he or she has any friends among those
present. That person then either sits at the table of a friend or at an unoccupied table is none of those present is a friend. Assuming that each
of the \( {$n}\choose{2} \) pairs of people are, independently, friends with probability \($p,\) find the expected number of occupied tables.
