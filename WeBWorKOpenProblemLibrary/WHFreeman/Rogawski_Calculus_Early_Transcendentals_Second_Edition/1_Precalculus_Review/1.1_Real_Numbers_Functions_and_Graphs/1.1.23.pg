$PAR
On the number line, numbers greater than \($x\) appear to the right, $BR hence
\(a > $x\) is 
 equivalent to the numbers to the right of \($x\).
$PAR

\(|a - $y|\) measures the distance from a to $y; hence  \(|a - $y| < \frac{1}{$x}\)
is satisfied $BR by those numbers less than \(\frac{1}{$x}\) from \($y\).  $PAR

\(|a-\frac{1}{$x}|\) measures the distance from a to \(\frac{1}{$x}\); hence \(|a-\frac{1}{$x}|<$y\) is satisfied $BR by those numbers 
that are less than \($y\) units from \(\frac{1}{$x}\). $PAR

The inequality \(|a| > $y\) is equivalent to \(a>$y\) or \(a<-$y\);  that is \(a\) lies to the right of \($y\) or $BR
to the left of \(-$y\). $PAR

The interval described by the inequality \(|a-$z|<$x\) has a center at \($z\) and a radius of \($x\); that is, $BR
the interval of those numbers between \($b\) and \($a\).  $PAR

The interval described by the inequality \(1<x<$y\) has a center at \($d\) and a radius of \($c\).
