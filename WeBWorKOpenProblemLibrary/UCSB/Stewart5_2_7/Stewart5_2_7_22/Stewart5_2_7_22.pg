$PAR
A roast turkey is taken from an oven when its temperature
has reached \(185^{\circ }\)F and is placed on a table in a room where the
temperature is \(75^{\circ }\)F.  $BR
The graph shows how the temperature of the turkey decreases and eventually approaches room temperature. (In Section~9.4 we will be able to use Newton's Law of Cooling to find an equation for \(T\)as a function of time.) $PAR

By measuring the slope of the tangent, estimate the
rate of change of the temperature after an hour.  Your answer
must be within 20${PERCENT} of the correct value.
