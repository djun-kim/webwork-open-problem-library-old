We start simply.  In the first few problems you will be asked to evaluate
some arithmetic expressions and enter the answer as a number into WeBWorK.
You may of course use a calculator.  The purpose of these first few
problems is to help you get familiar with WeBWorK.
In later problems you will be able to enter the answer as an
arithmetic expression,  but at present your answer must be a number
such as 4, -4, or 17.5. 

$BR
Evaluate the expression
$BR \( $a($b+$c) \) = \{ ans_rule(20) \}.
$BR

$answer = ($a)*($b+$c);

ANS(num_cmp($answer, mode=>"strict"));
