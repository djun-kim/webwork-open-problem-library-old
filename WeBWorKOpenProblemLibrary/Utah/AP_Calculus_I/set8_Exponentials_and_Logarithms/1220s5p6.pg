$BBOLD (This is an improved version of No 38 in Section 7.4)$EBOLD.  The
loudness of sound is measured in decibels in honor of Alexander Graham
Bell, inventor of the telephone.  A decibel is a dimensionless measure
of the ratio of two pressures.  If the sound pressure to be measured
is \( P \), then the sound loudness \( L \) in decibels is defined by
\[ \displaystyle L = 20 \log_{10}(121.3 \frac{P}{P_0}) \] where
\(P_0\) is a reference pressure at the limits of audibility.  Find the
ratio \(P/P_0\) if the pressure \(P\) is caused by a rock band at 115
decibels.

$PAR The pressure caused by the rock concert is
\{ans_rule(10)\} times higher than the barely audible reference
pressure.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Let's call the desired ratio
\[R=\frac{P}{P_0}.\] Substituting \( L = 115 \) and solving for \(R\)
gives \( R  \approx 4,636 \).  The original wording of the problem
would have you believe that the pressure is 4,636 pounds per square
inch. That kind of pressure would flatten the county.
