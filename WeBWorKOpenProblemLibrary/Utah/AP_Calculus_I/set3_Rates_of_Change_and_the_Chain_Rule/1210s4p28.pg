TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The radius of a spherical watermelon is growing at a constant rate
of 2 centimeters per week.  The thickness of the rind is always one
tenth of the radius.  The volume of the rind is growing at the rate
\{ans_rule(20) \} cubic centimeters per week at the end of the fifth
week. Assume that the radius is initially zero.

$pi = 2.0*acos(0.0); 
ANS(num_cmp(4*3*$pi*(2**3-1.8**3)*5*5/3));

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD  The radius of the watermelon after 
\(t\) weeks is 
\[r(t) = 2t.\]
The volume of the watermelon is
\[M(t) = \frac{4\pi (2t)^3}{3}.\]
The volume \(R(t)\) of the rind is
\[R(t) = \frac{4\pi (2t)^3}{3}-\frac{4\pi (0.9\times 2t)^3}{3} =
\frac{4\pi\left(8t^3-1.8^3t^3\right)}{3} = \frac{8.672\pi t^3}{3}.\]
Hence
\[R'(t) = \frac{26.016 \pi t^2 }{3}\approx  27.24\  \hbox{cubic 
centimeters
per week.}\]
At the end of the fifth week \(t=5\) and we obtain
\[R'(5) \approx 681.1 \ \hbox{cubic centimeters
per week.}\]
