TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Gravel is being dumped from a conveyor belt at a rate of $a1 cubic
feet per minute. It forms a pile in the shape of a right circular cone
whose base diameter and height are always equal to each other.  How
fast is the height of the pile increasing when the pile is $h1 feet
high? Recall that the volume of a right circular cone with height h
and radius of the base r is given by \(V= \frac{\pi}{3} r^2h \).
$BR Your answer:
\{ans_rule(20) \} feet per minute.

$ans = $deriv1;
ANS(num_cmp($ans));

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD The radius of the sand pile is half its diameter, i.e., half its height:
\[r=\frac{h}{2}.\] Substituting this in the volume formula gives
\[V =  \frac{\pi}{3} r^2h = \frac{\pi h^3}{12}.\]
Differentiating implicitly gives
\[V'= \frac{3\pi h^2 h'}{12} = \frac{\pi h^2 h'}{4}.\]
This can be solved for \(h'\):
\[h' = \frac{4 V'}{\pi h^2}.\]

Substituting 
\[h = $h1\quad\hbox{and}\quad V' = $a1\]
gives the answer:
\[h' \approx !{$ans:%7.6f} \hbox{~feet per minute}.\]
