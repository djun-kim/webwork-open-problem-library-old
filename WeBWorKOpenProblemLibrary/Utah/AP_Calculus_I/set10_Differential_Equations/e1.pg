TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));


The purpose of this problem is to help you prepare for the upcoming exam 1.
It will cover chapter 7, specifically the following items:

$BR

$BR The definitions of exponentials and logarithms and their
relationships.  Properties of exponentials and logarithms.


$BR Derivatives of functions involving exponentials and logarithms.
Those functions can be quite general, anything that is accessible to
the chain, quotient and product rules, and logarithmic
differentiation.  Often it is helpful to apply properties of
exponentials and logarithms before differentiating.

On the test there will be simpler questions, but here, for example, is
a problem that requires all of these rules:

$PAR \(\frac{\hbox{d}}{\hbox{d}x} \frac{\displaystyle e^{1+\ln
x^2}\sin(\ln x)}{\ln x} = \)
 \{ans_rule(80)\}.
EOT
ANS(fun_cmp("((e*2x*sin(lnx)+e*x^2*cos(ln(x))*1/x)*log(x)
-e*x^2*sin(log(x))/x)/log(x)^2", [2,3], vars=>["x"]));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));


$BR Integration of some functions involving exponentials and
logarithms, those that we can integrate.  Mostly these integrals are
based on substitution and can be thought of as obtained by the
inverses of the differentiation rules \[\frac{\hbox{d}}{\hbox{d}x}
\ln(f(x)) = \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}
\quad\hbox{and}\quad\frac{\hbox{d}}{\hbox{d}x} e^{f(x)} =
f'(x)e^{f(x)}.\] You want to recognize that pattern in the integrand.


For example,

$PAR
\(\int_0^{\pi/2} \sin x e^{\cos x} \hbox{d} x = \)  \{ans_rule(10)\}.

EOT
$a = exp(1) - 1;
ANS(num_cmp($a));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

$BR Simple applications of exponentials and logarithms, exponential
growth and decay, half life, doubling time, Carbon dating, compound
interest.

For example, suppose you have a growing culture of bacteria consisting 
of 56 individuals after 1 hour and 448 individuals after 2 hours.
Then its doubling time is  \{ans_rule(10)\} minutes and its
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(20));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
initial population consisted of \{ans_rule(10)\} individuals.  You can
solve this particular problem without doing any algebra, but you
should think about it and make sure you understand how to solve these
kinds of problems for any numbers.

$BR

For all of these topics, you should understand how to do problems
$BBOLD like$EBOLD the above, and like those on the home works and in the
textbook.  You are not well prepared if all you do is answer the
questions on this home work, particularly if it takes you several tries
and failed attempts.  Make sure you understand the concepts and
connections and you can move within the subject nimbly and at ease.

EOT

$answer = 7;

ANS(num_cmp($answer));
