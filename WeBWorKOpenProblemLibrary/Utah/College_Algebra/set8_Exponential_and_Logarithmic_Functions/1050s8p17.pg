Suppose \(f(t)\) is a function of the form \[f(t)=a^{bt}\] for some
constants \(a\) and \(b\).  Suppose \(t\) measures time in years, and
\(f(t)\) describes the decay of a radioactive isotope with a half
life of \(T\) years.

$BR

Then \(f(t) = \)  \{ ans_rule(20) \}.  (Your answer will be an expression involving \(t\) and \(T\).)

ANS(fun_cmp("2**(-t/T)", limits=>[[0,1],[2.5]], vars=>["t","T"]));


TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD  The choice of \(a\) and \(b\) are not unique, but the
function is, and WeBWorK will accept any correct choice of \(a\) and \(b\).
Just look for a half life of \(T\).
EOT



SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
\(f(t) = 2^{-t/T} \) is the most obvious choice, but you could also enter
\(f(t) = 4^{-t/(2T)}\)  or \(f(t) = e^{-t(\hbox{ln}2)/T}.\)
