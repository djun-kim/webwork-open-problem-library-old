Two zeros of the polynomial 
\[p(x) = x^4-4x^3-24x^2+20x+7\] are \(1\) and \(7\).  The other two zeros
are real, but irrational.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Since \(1\) and \(7\) are zeros of \(p\) we can divide by
\(x-7\) and \(x-1\) using synthetic division.  (We could also divide
by \[(x-1)(x-7) = x^2-8x+7,\]
using long division.)

$BR
We obtain

\[\begin{array}{rrrrrr}
    & 1  & -4  & -24  & 20  & 7  \\
1:  &    & 1   & -3  & -27  & -7  \\
    & 1  & -3  & -27 & -7   & 0 \\
7:  &    & 7   & 28  &  7   &  \\
    & 1  & 4   &  1  &  0   &\\
\end{array}
\]

Thus

\[p(x) = (x-1)(x-7)(x^2+4x+1).\]

We can find the zeros of the quadratic factor by the quadratic formula
or by completing the square.  They are

\[x= -2 \pm \sqrt{3}.\]
