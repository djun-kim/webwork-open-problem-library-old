TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

The next few problems reinforce your mastery of exponents.
Remember that you multiply powers with the same base by adding the
exponents, you divide them by subtracting the exponents, and you take
a power to a power by multiplying the exponents.  

$BR

We begin by reviewing some basic identities.

\[a^ma^n = a^z\]
where 
\(z =\)  \{ ans_rule(6) \}.
EOT

ANS(fun_cmp("m+n", vars=>["m","n"]));
