The next few problems are exercises in identifying the
(natural) domain of a function.  The concept of a function is very
general but for our purposes the inputs and outputs of a function are
real numbers.  The domain is the set of real numbers at which the
function can be evaluated, and the range is the set of all possible
outputs.  To determine the domain ask yourself at what points the
function can NOT be evaluated.  Usually this is because of an
undefined operation, which practically speaking means dividing  by
zero, or extracting the square root of a negative number.


$BR Let the function \(f\) be defined by
\[f(x) = \frac{$a x + $b}{$c x+$d}. \]
The domain of \(f\) contains all real numbers \(x\) except
\(x =\) \{ ans_rule(20) \}

ANS(num_cmp(-$d/$c));

$BR Hint:
Never divide by zero.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD 
In the expression that defines \(f\) the denominator \($c x+$d\) is zero if 
\(x=-$d/$c.\)  Thus that value of \(x\) is not in the domain of \(f\).
