or infinitely many solutions.  Indicate the type of the system for th
following examples by $BITALIC U $EITALIC , $BITALIC N $EITALIC , or

$BR Hint: 
The issues are discussed

If you can't tell the nature system by inspection try to solve the
system and see what happens.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
$BR
$BR \(\begin{array}{rrcl}2x+3y&=&5\\ 2x+3y &=& 6\\ \end{array} \)
has no solution since the left hand sides of the system are equal, but the right hand sides are not.  \(5\) does not equal \(6\).
$BR \(\begin{array}{rrcl}2x+3y&=&5\\ 2x+4y &=& 6\\ \end{array}\)
has a unique solution.  In fact, it is \(x=y=1\).
$BR \(\begin{array}{rrcl}2x+3y&=&5\\ 4x+6y &=& 10\\ \end{array}\)
has infinitely many solutions.  The second equation can be obtained
from the first by multiplying with \(2\) and so it is redundant.
Solving the first equation for \(y\) gives 
\(y=-\frac{2}{3}x+\frac{5}{3}\).  The infinitely many solutions of the
system are the coordinates of the points on the line described by that equation.
