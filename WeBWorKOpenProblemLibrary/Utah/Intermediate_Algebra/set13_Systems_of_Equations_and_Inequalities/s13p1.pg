TEXT(beginproblem());

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

As a warm-up solve the following linear system:
\[
\begin{array}{rrcl}
2x &+3y &=& 1 \\
x &-y &=& 3 \\
\end{array}
\]

The solution of this system is 
$BR
\(x=\) \{ ans_rule(4) \} and
EOT
ANS(num_cmp("2"));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
\(y=\) \{ ans_rule(4) \}.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp("-1"));


TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR Hint: 
Subtract twice the second equation from the first, or add three times the
second equation to the first.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Subtracting twice the second equation from the first gives the new equation
\(5y=-5\).  Thus \(y=-1\).  Substituting that value in the second
equation gives \(x+1=3\) or \(x=2\).
