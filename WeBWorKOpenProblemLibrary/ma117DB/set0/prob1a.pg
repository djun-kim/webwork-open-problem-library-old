BEGIN_TEXT
This problem demonstrates how you enter function answers into WeBWorK. $PAR
For example, the function \(\sin\; x\). When entering the function, you should enter
$BBOLD sin(x)$EBOLD, but WeBWorK will also accept$BBOLD sin x $EBOLD or even $BBOLD sinx$EBOLD. 
$PAR
We said you should enter sin(x) because you
are less likely to make a mistake this way. $BR
Try this to see what we mean: We want "sin of 2x"$BR
Type in: sin 2 x \{ans_rule(9) \}
$BR
Type in: sin(2 x) \{ans_rule(9) \}
$PAR

Click on the$BBOLD Preview Answers$EBOLD button below, 
and notice what expressions are displayed.  The $BBOLD value $EBOLD line is not there, since the answer is not a number. Then click on$BBOLD Submit Answers$EBOLD 
to see how your answers are graded. You can answer a problem as many times as you want (except for true/false or multiple choice).

$ans = "sin(2*x)";
