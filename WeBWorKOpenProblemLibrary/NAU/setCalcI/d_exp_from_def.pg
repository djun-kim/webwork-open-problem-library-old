$b=random(3,10,1);
$ans = round(100*log($b))/100;
# Since log($b$) is between 1 and 10, this rounding will give three significant figures.

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The definition of the derivative, applied to \(f(x) = $b^x\), results in the formula
\(
f'(x) = k * $b^x
\)
where
\[
k = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{$b^h - 1}{h} .
\]
$PAR
The value \(k\) cannot be determined using the usual tricks for evaluating limits.
Using your calculator, approximate the constant \( k \), rounded to three significant figures.
\( \vphantom{A^A}k \approx \) \{ &ans_rule(10) \} .
