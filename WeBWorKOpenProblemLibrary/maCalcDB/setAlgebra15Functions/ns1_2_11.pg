BEGIN_TEXT
At the surface of the ocean, the water pressure is the same as the air pressure above the water,
about \(15 \quad lb/in^2\),  Below the surface the water pressure increases by about \($slope \quad  lb/in^2 \)
for every 10 ft of descent.  
$BR
Write a function \( f(x) \) which expresses the water pressure in pounds per square inch as a function of the depth in inches 
below the ocean surface.
$BR   
\(f(x) = \) \{ ans_rule(30) \}
$BR
At what depth is the pressure \($depth \quad lb/in^2\)? Include the 
units in your answer: \{ ans_rule(20) \}
