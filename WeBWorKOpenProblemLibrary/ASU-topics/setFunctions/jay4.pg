BEGIN_TEXT
An open box is to be made from a flat square piece of material $a inches in length and 
width by cutting equal squares of length \(x\) from the corners 
and folding up the sides. 
$PAR
Write the volume \(V\) of the box as a function of \(x\).  Leave it as a product of factors; you
do not have to multiply out the factors.

$PAR
\(V =\) \{ ans_rule(15)\}

$PAR
$PAR
If we write the domain of the box as an open interval in the form \((a,b)\),
then what is \(a\)?    
	$PAR
	\(a =\) \{ ans_rule(15)\}
$PAR
and what is \(b\)?  
	$PAR
	\(b =\) \{ ans_rule(15)\}
