BEGIN_TEXT
A man has $ttl coins in his pocket, all of which are dimes and quarters.
If the total value of his change is $DOLLAR \{ sprintf("%.2f",$value) \}, how many dimes and how
many quarters does he have?
$BR
Your answer is:
$BR
Number of dimes equals \{ans_rule(25) \}
$BR
Number of quarters equals \{ans_rule(25) \}
$BR
