SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOF'));
$SOL $BR
The slope of the tangent line to a function \( f(x) \) at a point \( (x,y) \)
is given by the derivative of \( f \) at \( x \).  Thus, the first step is to 
find the derivative of \( f(x) = $a1 \sqrt{ x } \).  Using the rules 
for finding the derivatives of polynomials, we get \( f'(x) = 
\frac{1}{2}(\frac{$a1}{\sqrt{x}}) \). Therefore, \( f'($x1) = !{$m1:%5.4f} \).
$PAR

Now, to find the equation of the tangent line, note that being tangent to 
\( f(x) \) at the point \( ($x1, !{$y1:%5.4f}) \) means that the line goes through 
this point.  We already know that the slope of the line is \( !{$m1:%5.4f} \).  So
using the point-slope form of a line yields \( (y-!{$y1:%5.4f}) = 
!{$m1:%5.4f}(x-$x1) \) or \( y = !{$m1:%5.4f} x + !{$ans:%5.4f} \).
