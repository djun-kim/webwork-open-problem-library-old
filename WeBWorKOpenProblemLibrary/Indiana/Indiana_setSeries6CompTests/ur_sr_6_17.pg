The series \( \displaystyle \sum^\infty_{n=1} \; \frac 1{n\sqrt n}\) simplifies to
\( \displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac 1{n^{\frac 3 2}} \), which is clearly a p-series
(as per box #1, p.716) with \(p = \frac 3 2 > 1\), so the series converges.
Since all terms are positive, this means it also converges absolutely. $BR $BR

Thus we must choose:  "A. The series is absolutely convergent." and
"E. The series is a p-series." $BR

The easiest way to see that the series
\( \displaystyle \sum^\infty_{n=1} \; \frac{$a0 + \sin (n)}{\sqrt n}\) diverges is to
use the fact that \(-1 \leq \sin(n) \leq 1\) to see that
\( \displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{$a0 + \sin (n)}{\sqrt n}
	\geq	\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac 1 {\sqrt n}
	=		\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac 1 {n^{\frac 1 2}} \), a series that we
know diverges as a p-series by box #1, p.716 of Stewart.  $BR

Thus we must answer: "C. The series diverges." and
"G. We can decide whether this series converges
by comparison with a p series." $BR

The series \( \displaystyle \sum^\infty_{n=2} \; \frac 1{n \log($a1 +  n)}\) is difficult
to deal with without the integral test, but the integral test does (one may
be thankful) handle it rather simply:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\int_{1}^\infty \frac{dx}{x \log($a1+x)}
&=	\int_{1}^\infty \frac{\frac{dx}{x}}{\log($a1+x)}	\\\\
&=	\left \ln\left(\log($a1+x)\right) \right|_1^\infty	\\\\
&=	\lim_{n\to\infty} \ln\left(\log($a1+x)\right)
		- \ln\left(\log($a1+1)\right)	\\\\
&=	\infty - \ln\left(\log($soln_a1p1)\right) = \infty
\end{aligned}
\]
$BR

Thus we must answer "A. The series diverges." and
"K. None of the above reasons applies to the
convergence or divergence of the series." $BR

EOT
}
if ($slice[$i] == 3) {
if ($a2 == 2) { $soln_ser1 = '(2n+2) \cdot (2n+1)'; }
if ($a2 == 3) { $soln_ser1 = '(2n+3) \cdot (2n+2) \cdot (2n+1)'; }
if ($a2 > 3) { $soln_ser1 = "(2n+$a2) ".'\cdot \cdots \cdot (2n+1)'; }
&SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));

We can expand out the factorials in the series
\( \displaystyle \sum^\infty_{n=1} \; \frac{(2n + $a2 )!}{(n!)^2}\) to see the relative
sizes of the numerator and denominator:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(2n+$a2)!}{(n!)^2}
&=	\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\left( $soln_ser1 \right)
		\left( 2n \cdot (2n-1) \cdot \cdots \cdot (n+1) \right)
		\left( n \cdot (n-1) \cdot \cdots \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \right)}
		{\left( n \cdot (n-1) \cdot \cdots \cdot 1 \right)^2}	\\\\
&=	\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( $soln_ser1 \right)
		\left( \frac{2n \cdot (2n-1) \cdot \cdots \cdot (n+1)}
			{n \cdot (n-1) \cdot \cdots \cdot 1} \right)
		\left( \frac{n \cdot (n-1) \cdot \cdots \cdot 1}
			{n \cdot (n-1) \cdot \cdots \cdot 1} \right)	\\\\
&\geq	\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( $soln_ser1 \right)
\end{aligned}
\]
And clearly \(\displaystyle \lim_{n\to\infty} \left( $soln_ser1 \right) = \infty\). $BR

Thus we must answer "C. The series diverges." and
"J. The terms of the series do not have limit zero."  $BR

EOT
}
if ($slice[$i] == 4) {
&SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));

When you consider the series
\( \displaystyle \sum^\infty_{n=1} \; \frac{\cos (n\pi )}{ n\pi }\), a natural first question
to ask is what the sequence \(\cos (n\pi)\) looks like.  Since \(\cos\) is
periodic, and its period is a multiple of \(\pi\), that sequence will be
periodic also, so it is worth investigating:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\cos(n\pi)
&=	\cos(1\pi), \cos(2\pi), \cos(3\pi), \cos(4\pi), \cos(5\pi), \cdots	\\\\
&=	-1, 1, -1, 1, -1, \cdots	\\\\
&=	(-1)^n
\end{aligned}
\]
Thus we can rewrite this series as
\( \displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\cos(n\pi)}{n\pi}
	=	\frac 1 \pi \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n} \),
which clearly converges by the Alternating Series test, because
\(\displaystyle \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac 1 n = 0\).  However, we know that the series
\(\displaystyle \frac 1 \pi \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left| \frac{(-1)^n}{n} \right|
	=	\frac 1 \pi \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac 1 n\) diverges as a p-series by
box #1, p.716, so our series does not convere absolutely.$BR

So we must answer "B. The series converges, but not absolutely." and
"D. The alternating series test shows the series converges." $BR

if ($slice[$i] == 5) {
&SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));

When you consider the series
\( \displaystyle \sum^\infty_{n=1} \; \frac{\cos^2 (n \pi)}{n \pi}\), a natural first
question to ask is what the sequence \(\cos^2(n\pi)\) looks like.  Since
\(\cos\) is periodic, and its period is a multiple of \(\pi\), that sequence
will be periodic also, so it is worth investigating:
\[
\begin{aligned}
cos^2(n\pi)
&=	\cos^2(1\pi), \cos^2(2\pi), \cos^2(3\pi),
		\cos^2(4\pi), \cos^2(5\pi), \cdots	\\\\
&=	(-1)^2, 1^2, (-1)^2, 1^2, (-1)^2, \cdots	\\\\
&=	1, 1, 1, 1, 1, \cdots
\end{aligned}
\]
A very rewarding sequence to investigate!  We've simplified our original series
a great deal:
\(\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\cos^2(n\pi)}{n\pi}
	=	\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac 1 {n\pi}\).  We can further rewrite this by
pulling out the \(\displaystyle \frac 1 \pi\) to see that the series is actually
\(\displaystyle \frac 1 \pi \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac 1 n\), which diverges as a p-series
by box #1, p.716 of your text. $BR

Thus we must answer "C. The series diverges." and 
"G. We can decide whether this series converges
by comparison with a p series."
