#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
A bison is charging across the plain one morning.  His
path takes him to location \( (x,y) \) at time \( t \), 
where \( x \) and \( y \) are functions of \(t\), and 
north is in the direction of increasing \(y\).  The 
temperature is always colder farther north.  As time 
passes, the sun rises in the sky, sending out more heat,
and a cold front blows in from the east.  At time \(t\)
the air temperature \(H\) near the bison is given by
\( H = f(x,y,t) \).  The chain rule expresses the 
derivative \( dH / dt \) as a sum of three terms:
$BR
\[
\frac{dH}{dt} 
= 
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \frac{\partial x}{\partial t}
+
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}
+
\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}.
\]
$BR
Identify the term that gives the contribution to the 
change in temperature experienced by the bison that is
due to:
$BR
\{
ColumnTable(
$ml->print_q(),
$ml->print_a(),
indent => 0, separation => 20, valign => "MIDDLE"
); 
\}
