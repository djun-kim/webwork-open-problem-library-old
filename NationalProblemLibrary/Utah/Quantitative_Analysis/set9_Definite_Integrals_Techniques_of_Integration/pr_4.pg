TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
A ball is shot straight up into the air with initial velocity of
 \(!{$initialSpeed}\) ft/sec.  Assuming that the air resistance
 can be ignored, how high does it go?  
Hint No four million and fifty-eight: 
now this one is identical to the previous, 
except for now we don't have a car decelerating 
on the horizontal, we have a ball decelerating in the vertical.  
Again, the acceleration is constant-is it positive or negative?  
ps: if any of you ever take a basic course in physics, 
you will encounter approximately a billion of these types of problems.

Hint:  The acceleration due to gravity is 32 ft per second squared.
