TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The slope of the tangent line to the graph of the
function \(y = $a0 x^3 \) at the point \( ($x0 , $y0) \)
is \( \text{lim}_{ x\mapsto $x0 } \frac {$a0 x^3 -$y0 }{x- $x0} \).
By trying values of \( x \) near \( $x0 \), find the slope of
the tangent line.  I would suggest picking a value so near \( $x0 \) that you are only \( 0.0001 \) under or over.  This will give you a more accurate representation of what is occuring near the point.
