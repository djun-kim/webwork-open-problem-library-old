TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Suppose you subtract a polynomial of degree \(m\)  from a polynomial of degree \(n\)
where \(m > n \).  Then the result is a polynomial of degree
\{ ans_rule(5) \}

$BR Hint: 
Compare with the preceding problem.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
This is exactly like the preceding problem.  Subtracting a polynomial
is the same as adding it after multiplying it with \(-1\).  As far as
that degree statement adding or subtracting a polynomial are
equivalent.
