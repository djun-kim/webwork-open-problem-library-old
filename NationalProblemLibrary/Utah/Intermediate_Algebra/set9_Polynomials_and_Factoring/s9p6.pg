You drop a rock into a deep well.  You can't see the rock's impact at
the bottom, but you hear it after $t seconds.  The depth of the well is
\{ ans_rule(10) \} feet. 

Ignore air resistance.
The time that passes after you drop the rock has two components: the time it 
takes the rock to reach the bottom of the well, and the time that it
takes the sound of the impact to travel back to you. Assume the speed
of sound is 1100 feet per second.

$ans = (-137.5+sqrt(18906.25+1100*$t))**2;
$depth = int($ans+0.5);

$t0 = -275/8+5*sqrt(3025+176*$t)/8;
$foo = int(10000*$t0);
$t0=$foo/10000;

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
The easiest way to solve this problem is to compute first the time that
the rock takes to travel to the bottom of the well, and then to compute
the depth.  So let \(t\) be that time.  Then the sound takes \($t-t\)
seconds to travel back to your ear.  The sound and the rock cover the
same distance, so we have the equation
\[16t^2 = 1100($t-t).\]
This is a quadratic equation with the solution
\[t = $t0.\]
Hence the depth of the well is given by
\[d = 16\times $t0^2 \approx $depth\hbox{~feet}.\]
