TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
You have a 5 foot long ladder, and you lean it against a wall such
that the bottom of the ladder is 3 feet away from the wall.  The top
of the ladder touches the wall at a height of \{ ans_rule(5) \} feet.

$BBOLD Note: $EBOLD The greatest obstacle to progress in mathematics is 
the human
inability to distinguish reliably between a plus and a minus sign.  Make
sure you check the solution of this problem after the set closes!

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD  The ladder, the piece of the wall from the
floor to the top of the ladder, and the horizontal piece of the floor
from the wall to the bottom of the ladder form a right triangle whose
hypotenuse has length 5, and one side has length 3.  Let's say the
third side has length \(x\).  Since the long side has length \(5\)
we know that 
\[x^2+3^2=25\]
and hence
\[x^2 = 25 - 9 = 16 \qquad\Longrightarrow\qquad x = 4.\]
The ladder touches the wall at a height of four feet.

There is actually a $BBOLD story$EBOLD to this problem.  I'm telling you it
not just for your entertainment but to show you that you shouldn't be
afraid to embarrass yourself ... your teacher has been much more
thorough at this than you ever will be.

We get a fair number of calls from the public on mathematical
issues. Years ago I passed by the office and the secretary asked if I
could answer such a question. I said sure, and we had this
conversation:

$BBOLD Caller:$EBOLD Yes, Hi, this is Joe of Radio XYZ. We are on the air and we
have this math contest, and there's a question we can't answer. Can
you help us?

$BBOLD Me:$EBOLD I'll try.

$BBOLD Joe:$EBOLD There's this ladder, and it's 5 feet long, and it's leaning
against the wall and it's bottom is 3 feet away from the wall. At what
height does it touch the wall?

$BBOLD Me:$EBOLD Oh, that's easy, you just use the Pythagorean Theorem.

$BBOLD Joe:$EBOLD That's what we thought, but just how does it work?

$BBOLD Me:$EBOLD Well, you square 5, that's 25, and you square 3, that's 9,
25+9=34, and you take the square root. I don't know the square root of
34, but it's just under 6.

$BBOLD Joe:$EBOLD So the ladder touches the wall at a height of about 6 feet?

$BBOLD Me:$EBOLD Yes!

$BBOLD Joe:$EBOLD That's awfully high!

$BBOLD Me:$EBOLD Yes, but it's just the Pythagorean Theorem.

$BBOLD Joe:$EBOLD What's your name?

$BBOLD Me:$EBOLD Peter Alfeld.

$BBOLD Joe:$EBOLD Pete! Pete, can we quote you? Can we say that Pete of the
University of Utah Math Department says the ladder touches the wall at
a height of 6 feet?

$BBOLD Me:$EBOLD Sure!

So I hang up and realize that I just invented a five foot ladder that
can reach a height of six feet. The savings in aluminum alone ... But
I don't remember the name of the station, so I can't call
back. Presumably my folly was broadcast over the entire Salt Lake
Valley! I avoided the streets of Salt Lake City for a few months, and
to this day I make sure to mention in every course I teach that the
greatest obstacle to progress in mathematics is the human inability to
distinguish reliably between a plus and a minus sign.
