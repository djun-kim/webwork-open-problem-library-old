TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
A 10-foot plank is used to brace a basement wall during construction
of a home.  The plank is nailed to the wall 6 feet above the floor.
The slope of the plank is \{ ans_rule(5) \}.
EOT
&ANS(num_cmp(3/4));

Hint: Draw a picture.  You also need to understand
the concept of the
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/straight/index.html#slope",
"slope")\} 
of a straight line.
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Proceeding as in the preceding problem we
find that the bottom of the plank is \(8\) away from the wall. The
slope of the plank equals \[\frac{\hbox{rise}}{\hbox{run}} =
\frac{6}{8}=\frac{3}{4}.\]
