TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The next few problems serve as a warm up for the next homework set which
will deal with linear systems of equations.  Consider the system of
equations
\[
\begin{array}{rcrccl}
x&+&y&=&11\\
x&-&y&=&10\\
\end{array}
\]
(Do you recognize this system?) Its solution is
$BR
\(x=\)\{ ans_rule(6) \} and

&ANS(num_cmp("10.5"));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
\(y=\)\{ ans_rule(6) \}.
EOT
&ANS(num_cmp("0.5"));

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR Hint: 
Even though this is a simple problem, use the 
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/lisys/",
"general method")\} for solving linear systems.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
This is like the pot and lid problem encountered earlier in the
course, and its solution is \(x=10.5\) and \(y=0.5\).  In terms of the
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/lisys/",
"general method")\} for solving linear systems we obtain the table:

\[
\begin{array}{lrrrr}
\hbox{equation}&x&y&\hbox{RHS}&\hbox{RS}\\ \\
{[1]}&1&1&11&11\\
{[2]}&1&-1&10&10\\
{[3]=[1]+[2]}&2&0&21&23\\
\end{array}
\]
The last row of this table means that \(2x=21\) or \(x=10.5\).
Substituting \(x\) in the first equation gives \(y=0.5\).
