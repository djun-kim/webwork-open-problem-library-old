TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
This is a true story!  In 2002 the Math Department obtained two 
new buildings, the Leroy Cowles Building and the T Benny Rushing
Mathematics Student Center.  We had to evaluate furniture bids from
various manufacturers that offered various discounts.  One
manufacturer offered a "30+30" percent discount.  This means they cut
30 percent off the list price and then took another 30 percent off the
discounted price.  Other manufacturers offered various single
discounts.  All other things being equal you prefer the single
discount if it is greater than
\{ ans_rule(5) \} percent.
