\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/lisys/",
"Linear systems of equations")\} arise frequently in applications.
They are usually solved by Gaussian Elimination and Backward Substitution.
When working by hand it is crucial to organize the computation in a clear
way that lets you check your calculations so far.   A linear system 
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/more/",
"may have none, one, or infinitely many solutions.")\}

$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD

Adding the equations eliminates \(y\) and gives \(6x = 8\), i.e.,
\(x=\frac{4}{3}\)
Substituting \(x\) in the first equation gives \(\frac{16}{3}-y= 3\), i.e., \(y=\frac{7}{3}.\)
