The next three problems have you redo the steps illustrated in the
previous problems for different lines and different points.  You can
do them right away, or first do problem 18 and and then apply the
formulas that you'll derive there.


$BR The point \((0,1)\)
has the distance \{ ans_rule(15) \} ,
from the line defined by
\[y = -2x-1\] 
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(sqrt(4/5)));






SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD  The line through \((0,1)\) and
perpendicular to the line given by \(y = -2x-1\) has the equation
\(y= \frac{x}{2}  +1 \) and the two lines intersect in the point
\(\left(-\frac{4}{5},\frac{3}{5}\right).\)  The distance \(d\) between the two points
is
\[d = \sqrt{\left(0+\frac{4}{5}\right)^2 +
\left(1-\frac{3}{5}\right)^2}=
\sqrt{\frac{20}{25}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}.\]
