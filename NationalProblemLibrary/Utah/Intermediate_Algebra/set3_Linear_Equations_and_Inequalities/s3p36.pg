Suppose you go to an event where children's tickets cost $DOLLAR 5 and
adult's tickets cost $DOLLAR 10.  You buy 6 tickets for $DOLLAR
40. There are \{ ans_rule(20) \} adults

and \{ ans_rule(20) \} children in your party.
EOT
&ANS(arith_num_cmp(4));

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR Hint:
Just look at the possible numbers of adults.  There aren't that many.
Later in the semester we will learn how to solve this kind of problem
when there are huge numbers of dollars and tickets.
