$total = 199;
$unpicked = 84;

$totalscore = 62;
$unpickedscore = 58;

$pickedscore = int(($total*$totalscore - $unpicked*$unpickedscore)/($total-$unpicked)+0.5);

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Finally, here is a real life word word problem.  During the Fall of
2006, in Exam 2 of Math 1010-1 (our class), $total people took the
exam and received an average score of $totalscore$PERCENT.  $unpicked
people did not pick up their exam, presumably because they did not
attend class on the day the exam was handed back.  Those people had an
average score of $unpickedscore$PERCENT.  Thus the people who did pick
up their exams, and presumably did attend class, had an average score
of \{ ans_rule(5) \} $PERCENT.  (Round your answer to the nearest
integer.)

$PAR 
Of course, assuming attendance on a particular day is correlated with
attendance in general, the moral of the story is that it pays to come
to class. I would have liked to see this case made more
forcefully, but the above are the actual figures.
