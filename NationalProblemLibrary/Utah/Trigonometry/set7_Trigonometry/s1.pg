TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
This and the following three problems cover some subtleties of the
inverse trig functions.  In these problem, WeBWorK will not accept as
answers mathematical expressions that involve the trigonometric
functions or their inverses. You need to enter numbers.

$BR
In this problem let's measure angles in degrees.  As discussed in
class, the inverse sin function returns an angle between -90 and +90
degrees.  This gives perhaps surprising results when you evaluate the
sine somewhere and then the inverse sine at the result.  You can just
key the problems below and in the following problems into your
calculator, but try to get them without a calculator.  If you yield to
temptation and do use your calculator, at least think about the
answers when they are unexpected.  $BR
Complete the
following equations:
$BR
\(\arcsin(\sin(37^\circ))=\) \{ ans_rule(12) \}\({}^\circ\),
EOT
&ANS( strict_num_cmp(37));


TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
\(\arcsin(\sin(-25^\circ))=\) \{ ans_rule(12) \}\({}^\circ\),
EOT
&ANS( strict_num_cmp(-25));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
\(\arcsin(\sin(100^\circ))=\) \{ ans_rule(12) \}\({}^\circ\),
EOT
&ANS( strict_num_cmp(80));
