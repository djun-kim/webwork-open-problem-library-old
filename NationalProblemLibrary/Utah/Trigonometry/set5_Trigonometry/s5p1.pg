You may think this first problem a little odd.  All it asks is that
use your calculator to evaluate the trigonometric functions of some
angles.  The reason for including this problem is the observation that
a substantial number of mistakes in solving trig problems are due to
having your calculator in the wrong mode, and not noticing this fact.
Whenever you use your calculator check its mode!

$BR In this problem you will need to enter your answers as decimal
approximations (with at least 4 digits).  Usually WeBWorK will let you
enter expressions like sin(...), but note that in that case WeBWorK
always assumes your angles are measured in radians.
