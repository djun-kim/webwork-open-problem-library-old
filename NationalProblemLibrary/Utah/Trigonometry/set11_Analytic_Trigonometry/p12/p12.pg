(This is problem 38 on page 500 of the textbook.)  A flagpole at right
angle to the horizontal is located on a slope that makes an angle of
\(12^\circ\) with the horizontal. The pole's shadow is 16 meters long and
points directly up the slope. The angle of elevation from the tip
of the shadow to the sun is \(20^\circ\).
The height of the pole is 
 \{ans_rule(12) \} meters.

$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD Draw a triangle and apply the Law of Sines.
Note that the shadow points up the slope starting from the bottom of
the flag pole. The angle of elevation is the angle made with the
horizontal (not with the ground).

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD The flag pole and its shadow form a triangle
that has an angle of \(78^\circ\) at the bottom of the pole,
\(70^\circ\) at the top of the pole, and \(32^\circ\) at the end of
the shadow, as indicated in this picture:
$BR
\{image("p12.gif", height =>154, width => 320);\}
$BR

  Letting \(h\) denote the height of the flag pole, the Law of
Sines tells us that \[\frac{h}{\sin32^\circ} =
\frac{16}{\sin70^\circ}.\] Thus \[h = \frac{16\sin
32^\circ}{\sin70^\circ} \approx 9.022 \hbox{meters}.\]
