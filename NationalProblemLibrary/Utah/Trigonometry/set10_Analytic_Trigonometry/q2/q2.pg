This is like the preceding problem, except that the numbers are a
little different. A ship is moving due west at $v1 knots.  You are in
a speed boat at a distance of $d nautical miles from the ship.  Your
bearing as seen from the ship is $bdeg degrees.  You need to catch up
with the ship.  So you take off at a speed of $v2 knots and a bearing of 
\{ans_rule(24) \} degrees, and 
EOT
&ANS( num_cmp(270+$alpha));

you reach the ship in \{ ans_rule(24) \} minutes.
Enter your answers as decimal expression with at least four digits, or

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD You may be able to solve this particular
problem more easily using the specific numbers provided, but since
those are different for each student, let me consider a more general
problem, as illustrated in this Figure:

\{image("p.gif", height =>200, width => 464);\}

Suppose the ship is moving at a speed \(v_1\) and your boat moves at a
speed \(v_2>v_1\).  Also assume that you bearing from the ship is
\(\beta\) and your distance is \(d\).  Then the direction in which you
move is 270 degrees plus an angle \(\alpha\).  Let \(a\) and \(b\)
denote the east/west and north/south components of your distance from
the ship, as indicated in the Figure.  Furthermore, let \(x\) be the
distance that the ship covers before you catch up with it.  You
yourself cover a distance \[y= \frac{v_2}{v_1} x.\]

We are done if we can figure out the angle \(\alpha\).  So we need to
set up some equations.  We obtain directly from the Figure:

\[a=d \cos\left(\beta-\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = d\sin\beta,\]
\[b=d \sin\left(\beta-\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = -d\cos\beta,\]
and
\[(x+a)^2+b^2 = {\frac{v_2^2}{v_1^2}} x^2\]


The third of these equations is a quadratic equation for \(x\), and we
can solve it by completing the square:

\[\begin{array}{rclcl}
(x+a)^2+b^2 &=& {\frac{v_2^2}{v_1^2}} x^2  &|& \hbox{expand} \\ \\
x^2+2ax+a^2+b^2 &=& {\frac{v_2^2}{v_1^2}} x^2  &|& -{\frac{v_2^2}{v_1^2}} x^2 \\ \\
x^2+2ax+a^2+b^2 - {\frac{v_2^2}{v_1^2}} x^2 &=& 0 &|& \hbox{simplify} \\ \\
(1-{\frac{v_2^2}{v_1^2}}) x^2 +2ax + d^2 &=& 0  &|& \times (-1) \\ \\
({\frac{v_2^2}{v_1^2}}-1) x^2 -2ax - d^2 &=& 0  &|& \gamma={\frac{v_2^2}{v_1^2}}-1 \\ \\
\gamma x^2 -2ax - d^2 &=& 0  &|& \div \gamma \\ \\
 x^2 -\frac{2a}{\gamma}x - \frac{d^2}{\gamma} &=& 0  &|& +\frac{d^2}{\gamma}+\left(\frac{a}{\gamma}\right)^2 \\ \\
 x^2 -\frac{2a}{\gamma}x +\left(\frac{a}{\gamma}\right)^2 &=& \frac{d^2}{\gamma}+ \left(\frac{a}{\gamma}\right)^2 &|&\hbox{perfect square}  \\ \\
\left(x-\frac{a}{\gamma}\right)^2 &=&  \frac{d^2}{\gamma}+ \left(\frac{a}{\gamma}\right)^2 &|& \sqrt{~~~} \\ \\
x-\frac{a}{\gamma} &=&\pm\sqrt{  \frac{d^2}{\gamma}+ \left(\frac{a}{\gamma}\right)^2} &|& + \frac{a}{\gamma} \\ \\
x &=&\frac{a}{\gamma}\pm\sqrt{  \frac{d^2}{\gamma}+ \left(\frac{a}{\gamma}\right)^2} &|&  \\ \\
\end{array}
\]

Of these two solutions one is negative (query: why?) and so we need to
consider only the solution with the plus sign:

\[x=\frac{a}{\gamma}+\sqrt{ \frac{d^2}{\gamma}+
\left(\frac{a}{\gamma}\right)^2}\]

which allows us to compute \(x\) by substituting the expressions 
\(a= d\sin\beta\). 

The time to intercept, \(t\), is given simply by \[t=\frac{x}{v_1}.\]

For this particular problem, 
\[\beta=$bdeg^\circ,  \quad d= $d,\quad v_1 = $v1, \quad v_2=$v2,\]
and
\[x=$xx, \quad \alpha = $aa^\circ, \quad t= $tt\hbox{~minutes}.\]

The required bearing is $bearing degrees.
