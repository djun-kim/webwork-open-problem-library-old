TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
It's a little trickier to convert an angle that's given in decimal
notation into the minute/second notation.  Let's do it just once.
The angle \(a=6.75444...\) degrees can be written as
$BR
\(a=\) \{ ans_rule(4) \} \({}^\circ\)
EOT
&ANS(num_cmp(6));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
\{ ans_rule(4) \} \({}'\)
EOT
&ANS(num_cmp(45));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
\{ ans_rule(4) \} \({}''\).
EOT
&ANS(num_cmp(16));


TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD
We need to convert .75444... into minutes and seconds.  Recall that
one minute equals 1/60 degrees.  See how many minutes fit into
.75444... and then see how many seconds fit in what's left.
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Suppose \(a= x^\circ y' z''\).
Clearly \(x=6\).  To find \(y\) we ask how many minutes is in the remainder of  \[6.75444... - 6 = 0.7544...\] degrees.  
Since one degree has 60 minutes 
\[0.75444... \hbox{degrees} = 60\times 0.75444... = 45.2666...\hbox{minutes}.\]
So \(y=45\) and we have to convert \(.26666...\) minutes to seconds.  
Since a minute has 60 seconds we obtain
\(z=60\times 0..26666...=16.\)

$BR 
Thus
\[6.754444444...^\circ = 6^\circ 45' 16''.\]
