TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The diameter of the star Betelgeuse in the constellation of Orion is
approximately 200 million miles.  It's distance from earth is
approximately \(3 \times 10^{15}\) (3 quadrillion) miles (about 507
light years).  It subtends the angle \{ ans_rule(12) \} seconds of
degree.

$dB=2.0E8;

$pi=2.0*acos(0.0);
&ANS( num_cmp(2*atan($dB/2/$DB)/$pi*180*3600));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
A penny has a diameter of 0.75 inches.  You figure that Betelgeuse
subtends the same angle as a penny at a distance of \{ ans_rule(12) \} miles.
EOT

&ANS( num_cmp($DB*$dP/$dB));

$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD  
One degree is 3600 seconds of degree.  Proceed as in the preceding
problem, the validity of the mathematics is independent of the scale
of things.  For the second part of the problem think in terms of
similar triangles.
