TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

This is like the preceding problem, except it's more general.  Suppose
the speed of the wind is \(w\), the speed of the plane is \(p\), and the
ground speed is \(g\).  Let \(A\) denote the angle you plane needs to
make with the wind,  and \(B\) the angle that the wind makes with your
desired direction of travel, as illustrated in this Figure:
$BR
\{image("p11.gif", height =>148, width => 419);\}

{\bf For simplicity assume that the angles are measured in radians so that
you can use the WeBWorK trig functions and their inverses without
conversion.} 

Then
$BR
\(A=\) \{ans_rule(36) \}.

$BR
Your answer will be a mathematical expression in \(B\), \(p\) and \(w\).
$BR Once you have the angle \(A\) you can compute your ground speed using either the Law of Sines or the Law of Cosines.

$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD Apply the Law of Sines to get the angle.
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 

$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
As in the preceding problem, the law of sines gives
\[A=\arcsin\frac{w\sin B}{p}\]
and the law of cosines gives
\[g=\sqrt{p^2+w^2-2pw\cos(\pi-A-B)}.\]
