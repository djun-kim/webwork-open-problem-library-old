$BR
Suppose you have an  equilateral triangle with a height of \(h\) feet.
Then its area is
$BR
\(A=\) \{ ans_rule(24) \} square feet.
EOT
&ANS( multivar_function_cmp( "h^2/sqrt{3}", ["h"]));


 
TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD 
Draw the right triangle and its height.  The area of the triangle
equals of base times height.  You know the height.  Use the Pythagorean
Theorem to figure out the base.  Use \(sqrt(...)\) to enter the square root of something.
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Denote the base by \(x\).  The height  forms a right triangle where the other
short side has length \(\frac{x}{2}\).  The hypotenuse has length \(x\).  Thus
\(x\) satisfies the equation
\[h^2+\frac{x^2}{4} = x^2\]
which has the solution \[x=\frac{2h}{\sqrt{3}}.\]
Substituting in the area formula for the triangle we obtain
\[A=\frac{1}{2}\times x\times h = \frac{h^2}{\sqrt{3}}=\frac{\sqrt{3}h^2}{3}.\]
Either form can be entered into WeBWorK.
