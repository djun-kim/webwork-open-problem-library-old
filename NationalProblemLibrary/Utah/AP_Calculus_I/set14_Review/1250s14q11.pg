$BBOLD Integration by Substitution:$EBOLD  Some integrals are
obvious, others impossible, and yet others can be handled only with a bit of
cleverness.  In class we have been referring to the use of the formula
\[\int f(u(x)) u'(x) \hbox{d} x\] as the "obvious" substitution.
Look at the integrals below.  Remember that in WeBWorK we ignore the
integration constant, and for definite integrals you may have to
change the limits of integration when doing the integration.

\(\int e^{\sin(x)} \cos x \hbox{d} x=  \)
\{ans_rule(20)\},

$BR
\(\int_1^2 x\sin(x^2) \hbox{d} x = \) \{ans_rule(20)\}.

$BR
\(\int\frac{1}{x\ln x} \hbox{d} x = \) \{ans_rule(20)\}.
