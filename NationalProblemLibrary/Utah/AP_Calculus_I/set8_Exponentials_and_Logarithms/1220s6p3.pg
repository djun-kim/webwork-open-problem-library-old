TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Human hair from a grave in Africa proved to have only $a$PERCENT of
the carbon 14 of living tissue.  When was the body buried?  The half
life of carbon 14 is 5730 years. See Problem 13 of Section 7.5 of the
course text.

$PAR

The body was buried about \{ans_rule(40)\} years ago. 

EOT

$ans = ln($a/100)/$k;
$ANS = int($ans+0.5);

#ANS(num_cmp($ans, tolType=>"absolute", tol=>$absTol));
ANS(num_cmp($ans, relTol=>$absTol));


TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD From the text we learn the half-life of
Carbon-14 is 5730 years.  Use this and the the information about $a $PERCENT
to help you find \(r\) as in exercise 1 of this same set. Then find \( t \).
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR
$BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Similarly to exercise 1 of this same set, find
\( r\) by setting \(.5P_{0} = P_{0}e^{r5730} \), since 5730 is the
half-life.  Solve this for \(r\) and use this and the given $a$PERCENT to
set up \(.$A P_{0} = P_{0}e^{rt}\) and solve for \( t \) to find that
\( t \) = $ANS.
