This problem is about polynomial degrees.  Recall that the $BITALIC degree$EITALIC of a
polynomial \(p\) is \(n\) if \(p\) can be written as \[p(x) =
a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\ldots+a_1x+a_0\] where the $BITALIC leading
coefficient $EITALIC \[a_n\neq 0.\]

$BR
The degree of
\(p(x) = 1\) is  \{ ans_rule(10) \}.
EOT
&ANS( num_cmp(0));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
The degree of
\(p(x) = x^2+2x+3\) is  \{ ans_rule(10) \}.
EOT
&ANS( num_cmp(2));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
The degree of
\(p(x) = \big((x+2)^2(x-1)^3\big)^2\) is  \{ ans_rule(10) \}.
EOT
&ANS( num_cmp(10));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
Let \(p\) and \(q\) be polynomials of degree \(m\)
and \(n\), respectively.
$BR
The degree of the $BITALIC product$EITALIC of \(p\) and \(q\) is
 \{ ans_rule(10) \}.
EOT
&ANS( multivar_function_cmp( "m+n", ["m","n"] ) );

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
and the degree of the $BITALIC composition$EITALIC of
\(p\) and \(q\) is
 \{ ans_rule(10) \}.
EOT
&ANS( multivar_function_cmp( "m*n", ["m","n"] ) );


TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD The product of two polynomials \(p\) and \(q\)
is \[h(x) = p(x)\times q(x)\] and the composition of \(p\) and \(q\)
is \[h(x) = p(q(x))\] or \[h(x) = q(p(x)).\] (The two compositions are
distinct but they have the same degree.  If you are still confused
look at simple examples.
