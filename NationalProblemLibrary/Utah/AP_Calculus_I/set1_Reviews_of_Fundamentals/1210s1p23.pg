TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
This is the general version of the preceding problem.  Suppose the
speed of sound is \(c\), and gravity is \(g\).  Thus if you throw the
rock from an initial height \(h_0\) and with an initial velocity
\(v_0\) the height \(h(t)\) of the rock after time \(t\) is \[h(t)
=-\frac{g}{2}t^2 + v_0 t + h_0.\] (The $BITALIC height$EITALIC is negative when
the rock is below ground level.  Thus you can think of $BITALIC depth$EITALIC as
negative $BITALIC height$EITALIC.)  Suppose you hear the impact after \(t\)
seconds.  Then the depth of this well is
$BR
\(d=\) \{ans_rule(40)\}.  
$BR
(Your answer will be a mathematical expression involving \(t\), \(g\), and \(c\).)
$BR

$ans= "(-c/sqrt(2*g)+sqrt(c**2/(2*g)+c*t))**2";
&ANS(multivar_function_cmp($ans, ["t","g","c"], [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]));

Set up and solve a
quadratic equation.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Proceeding as in the solution of the preceding problem we obtain

\[d = \left( - \frac{ c }{  \sqrt{2g}} + \sqrt{\frac{c^2 }{ 2 g}  + ct} \right)^2.\]

You can enter this expression into ww for example by typing
$BR
$BITALIC (-c/sqrt(2*g)+sqrt(c**2/(2*g)+c*t))**2$EITALIC
