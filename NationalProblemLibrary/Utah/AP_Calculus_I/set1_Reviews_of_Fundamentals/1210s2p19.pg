$PAR
The function
\(f(x) = x^2 + $a1 x + $a0 \)
can be obtained from an even function \(g\) by shifting its graph horizontally and
vertically.  That even function is \(g(x) = \)  \{ ans_rule(10)\}.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD We see by completing the square that
\[f(x) = (x-$h)^2 + $v.\]
Thus the graph of \(f\) is the graph of \[g(x) = x^2\] shifted 
$h to the right and $v up.
