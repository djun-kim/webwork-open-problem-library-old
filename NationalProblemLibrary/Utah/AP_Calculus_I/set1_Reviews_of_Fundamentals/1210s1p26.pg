TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
(This is problem 35 on page 22 of the textbook, with slightly
different numbers.  See the Figure on that page.)  The ceiling of an
attic makes an angle of \(40^\circ\) with the floor.  A pipe of radius
6 inches is placed along the edge of the attic in such a way that the
pipe touches both the ceiling and the floor of the attic. The distance
from the edge of the attic to the point where the pipe touches the
floor is
 \{ ans_rule(20) \} inches.

$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD The form of the answer given in the appendix of
the textbook for the original problem suggests that it can be computed
using just the Pythagorean Theorem.  Let me know if you find such a
way.  I computed the answer by finding a right triangle and applying
some very basic trigonometry.  If your answer contains a trigonometric
function remember that WeBWorK does not know what a degree is.  You
need to use radians.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD The line from the edge of the attic to the
center of the pipe bisects the angle of 40 degrees.  It forms a right
triangle with the floor and the vertical radius of the pipe.  If the
required distance is \(x\) then \[\frac{x}{6} = \tan 20^\circ, \] and
hence 
\[x = \frac{6}{\tan 20^\circ } \approx 16.48\hbox{inches}.\]
