You say goodbye to your friend at the intersection of two
perpendicular roads.  At time \(t=0\) you drive off North at a
(constant) speed \(v\) and your friend drives West at a (constant)
speed \(w\).  You badly want to know: how fast is the distance between
you and your friend increasing at time \(t\)?  Enter here the
derivative of the distance from your friend with respect to \(t\):

\{&ans_rule(15)\}

EOT
$ans="sqrt(v^2+w^2)";
&ANS( multivar_function_cmp( $ans, ["v","w"], [[1,100],[1,100]] ) );


TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));


Being scientifically minded you ask yourself how does the speed of 
separation change with time.  In other words, what is the second
derivative of the distance between you and your friend?

\{&ans_rule(2)\}
EOT

ANS(std_num_cmp(0));




TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Suppose that after your friend takes off (at time \(t=0\)) you linger
for an hour to contemplate the spot on which he or she was standing.
After that hour you drive off too (to the North). How fast is the
distance between you and your friend increasing at time \(t\) (greater
than one hour)?  

\{&ans_rule(60)\}

EOT
$ans="(v^2*(t-1)+w^2*t)/sqrt(v^2*(t-1)^2+w^2*t^2)";
&ANS( multivar_function_cmp( $ans, ["v","w","t"], [[1,100],[1,100],[1,2]] ) );

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
Again, you ask what is the second derivative of your separation:

\{&ans_rule(90)\}
EOT
$ans="
(v^2*w^2)/(sqrt((t-1)^2*v^2+w^2*t^2)*((t-1)^2*v^2+w^2*t^2))
";
&ANS( multivar_function_cmp( $ans, ["v","w","t"], [[1,100],[1,100],[1,2]] ) );



TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
If you wish e-mail me your comments on how lingering makes things
harder, mathematically speaking.
