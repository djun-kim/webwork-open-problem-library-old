TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
This entertaining problem does not require Calculus for its solution.
It is included here to help set the stage for our next topic: the Calculus of exponential and logarithmic functions.

$PAR
Your village depends for its food on a nearby fishpond.  One day the
wind blows a water lily seed into the pond, and the lily begins to
grow.  It doubles its size every day, and its growth is such that it
will cover the entire pond (and smother the fish population) in 45
days.  You are away on vacation, and the villagers depend on
your vigilance and intelligence to handle their affairs.  Without you
present they will take action about that lily only on regular work
days, and only when the lily covers half the pond or more.  The lily
will cover half the pond \{ ans_rule(15) \} days after it first starts
growing.  The day it reaches that size happens to be a holiday....

common sense.

$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
The lily will cover half the pond on the 44-th day.  Within the next
24 hours it will double its size and cover the whole pond.
