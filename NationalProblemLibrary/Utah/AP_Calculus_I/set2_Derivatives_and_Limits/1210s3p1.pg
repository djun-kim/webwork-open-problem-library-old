Many times in this class we will solve quadratic equations.  You may
be used to applying the quadratic formula, and that's fine, but of
course the variables \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) may occur in your
quadratic equations in different ways than they are used in the
quadratic formula.  This problem illustrates the translation from
formula to problem, that may be necessary.

$BR
There are two solutions of the equation \[bx^2 -cx + a^2 = 0 \] (where
\(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are constants, and \(x\) is the unknown).
They differ by the sign of the square root. Enter the one with the
plus sign here \{ans_rule(80)\}.
EOT
$ans="(c+sqrt(c^2-4*a^2*b))/(2*b)";
&ANS( multivar_function_cmp( $ans, ["a","b","c"], [[0,1],[0,1],[4,9]] ) );
