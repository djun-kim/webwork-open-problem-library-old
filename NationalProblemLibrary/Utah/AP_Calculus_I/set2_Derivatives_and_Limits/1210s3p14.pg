More derivatives:
The derivative of 
\[p(x) = (2x-1)^2\]
is
\(p'(x) = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \}.  
EOT
ANS(fun_cmp("4*(2x-1)", [[0,1]], vars=>["x"]));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
$BR
The derivative of 
\[q(x) = (2x-1)^3\]
is
\(q'(x) = \) \{ ans_rule(30) \}.  
EOT
ANS(fun_cmp("3*(2x-1)**2*2", [[0,1]], vars=>["x"]));

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD As we will learn soon, there are more advanced
ways of doing this, but you can compute the derivative by expanding
the given expressions and writing each of \(p\) and \(q\) in the
standard form of a polynomial.
