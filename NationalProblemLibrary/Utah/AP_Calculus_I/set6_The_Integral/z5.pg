TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
According to Richard Graham in "SR-71 Revealed: The Inside Story", the
Lockheed SR-71 Reconnaissance plane accelerates from a standing start
to a speed of Mach 3 (3 times the speed of sound) "in about 14
minutes".  (During that time it also climbs to an altitude of about
70,000 feet, so the acceleration is not as impressive as you might
otherwise expect.)  Assuming that the time is exactly 14 minutes, and
the speed of sound is 1100 feet per second, this is an average
acceleration of \{ans_rule( 25)\} feet per second squared.  Assuming
that the acceleration is constant, during that time your SR-71 covers a
distance of \{ans_rule( 25)\} miles.

$PAR By the way, you can see an SR-71 on display in the Hill Air Force
Museum in Roy. It looks a little dusty, and it's clear that its best
days are over, but the plane is fiercely elegant and powerful. It
still presents an impressive sight.
