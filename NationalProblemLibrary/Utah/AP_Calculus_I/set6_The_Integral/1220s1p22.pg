$BBOLD More on Areas.$EBOLD
Farmer Jones, and his wife, Dr. Jones, both mathematicians, decide to
build a fence in their field, to keep the sheep safe. Being
mathematicians they decide that the fences are to be in the shape of
the parabolas \(y = $a x^2\) and \(y = x^2 + $b\).  What is the area of
the enclosed region?

ANS(num_cmp($answer));

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD The two parabolas intersect each other when
\[$a x^2 = x^2+$b,\]
i.e., when
\[ x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{$b}{$a-1}}= \pm c = \pm $C.\]
The area between the two parabolas is, therefore,
\[A= \int_{-c}^{c} x^2+$b-$a x^2 \hbox{d} x = $A.\]
