TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
In the next few problems we will explore the mathematics of motion
with constant acceleration, and apply it to falling objects and
accelerating and decelerating vehicles.  Unless otherwise stated
assume that we use feet and seconds as our units for length and time.
Some of the problems may not require Calculus (i.e., differentiation
or integration) for their solution, but that's OK, you want to be
able to solve all problems that come along.


As a warmup, let's practice some conversions. A speed of \(m\) miles
per hour equals a speed of \{ans_rule( 25) \} feet per second, and a
speed \(f\) feet per second equals a speed of \{ans_rule( 25) \} miles
per hour.  Recall that there are 5280 feet in a mile, and 3600 seconds
in an hour.


Recall that velocity is the derivative of distance, and acceleration
is the derivative of velocity.  Suppose that acceleration is constant,
and equal to \(A\). Suppose at time 0 your velocity is \(V\).  (To
accommodate WeBWorK idiosyncrasies, I'm using upper case to denote
constants.)

$PAR Let \(v(t)\) denote your velocity at time \(t\). Then $PAR \(v(t)
= \) \{ans_rule( 25) \}.

Suppose at time \(t=0\) your distance (in whatever direction you are
moving) is D.

$PAR Let \(d(t)\) denote your distance at time \(t\).  Then $PAR
\(d(t) = \) \{ans_rule( 25) \}.

$PAR Let's translate that into a familiar context.  Suppose \(A=-32\)
feet per second squared, \(h(t)\) is you height at time \(t\), \(H\)
is your initial height, and \(V\) is your initial velocity.  Then your
height \(h(t)\) at time \(t\) is \(h(t) = \) \{ans_rule( 25) \}, your
velocity at time \(t\) is \(v(t) = h'(t) = \) \{ans_rule( 25) \}, and
your acceleration at time(t) is, of course, \(a(t) = v'(t) = h''(t) =
\)  \{ans_rule( 25) \} feet per second squared.
