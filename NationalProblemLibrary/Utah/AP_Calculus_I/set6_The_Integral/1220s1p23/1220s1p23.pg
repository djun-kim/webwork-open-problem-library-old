$BBOLD Yet More on Areas.$EBOLD
There is a line through the origin that divides the region bounded by the parabola \( y = $a x - $b x^2 \) and the x-axis into two regions with equal area.  What is the slope of that line?

$answer = $a * (1-2**(-1/3));
ANS(num_cmp($answer));
$ans = int(10000*$answer+0.5);
$ans = $ans/10000;

parabola and the line in terms of the slope of the line, and solve for
the slope.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Let's consider the more general parabola
\[y = ax-bx^2\] where \(a\) and \(b\) are positive.  

$PAR
This Figure shows the situation for \(a=8\) and \(b=2\):

\{image("area.gif", width =>  400, height => 400);\}

$PAR

The parabola intersects the \(x\)-axis in the origin and at
\(x=\frac{a}{b}.\).  The area between the parabola and the \(x\) axis
is \[A = \int_0^{\frac{a}{b}} ax - bx^2 \hbox{d} x =
\frac{a^3}{6b^2}.\] The line \[y = mx\] intersects the parabola in the
origin and when \[ax-bx^2 = mx,\] i.e., \[ x = \frac{a-m}{b}.\] The
area between the parabola and the line is \[\frac{A}{2} =
\int_{0}^{\displaystyle\frac{a-m}{b}}ax-bx^2-mx \hbox{d} x =
\frac{(a-m)^3}{6b^2}.\] Since we know \(A\) we can solve for \(m\):
\[m = a\left(1-\frac{1}{\root 3 \of 2}\right).\]

$PAR

For this particular problem, 
\[a=$a,\quad b=$b,\quad \hbox{and}\quad m = $ans.\]
