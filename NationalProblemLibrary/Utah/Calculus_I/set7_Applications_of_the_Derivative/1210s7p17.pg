This is problem 28 on page 175 of the textbook.

$BR

The illumination at a point is inversely proportional to the square of
the distance of the point from the light source and directly
proportional to the intensity of the light source. Suppose two light
sources are \(s\) feet apart and their intensities are \(I\) and
\(J\), respectively. Let \(P\) be the point between them where the sum
of their illuminations is a minimum.  The distance of \(P\) from light
source \(I\) will be  \{&ans_rule(30)\} feet.  (Your answer will depend on 
\(I\), \(J\), and \(s\).)

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Let \(x\) be the distance of \(P\) from
light source \(I\).
We want to minimize
\[Q= \frac{I}{x^2} + \frac{J}{(s-x)^2}.\]
Differentiating with respect to \(x\) gives
\[Q' = -\frac{2I}{x^3} + \frac{2J}{(s-x)^3}.\]
Setting to zero and multiplying with the denominators gives
\[-2I(s-x)^3 + 2J x^3 = 0.\]
This can be rewritten as
\[\frac{I}{J} = \frac{x^3}{(s-x)^3} = \alpha^3 \]
where \[\alpha = \left(\frac{I}{J}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}.\]
Hence \[x = \alpha(s-x)\] which can be solved for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{\alpha s}{1+\alpha}   
  = \frac{\left(\frac{I}{J}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}}
     {1+\left(\frac{I}{J}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}}s  
= \frac{I^{\frac{1}{3}}s}{I^{\frac{1}{3}}+J^{\frac{1}{3}}}s 
\]
