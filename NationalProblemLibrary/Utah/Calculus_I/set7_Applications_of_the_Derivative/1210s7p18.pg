TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
This is problem 42 on page 176 of the textbook, see the Figure there.
A huge conical tank is to be made from a circular piece of sheet metal
of radius 10 meters by cutting out a sector with vertex angle \(\theta\)
and then welding together the straight edges of the remaining piece.
The angle $BR \(\theta = \) \{&ans_rule(20)\} radians will result in the
cone with the largest possible volume.

$BR There is a very detailed solution for this problem.  Make sure
you check it out after the set closes.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
The volume \(V\) of a cone of radius \(r\) and height \(h\) is
given by
\[V = \frac{\pi r^2 h}{3}.\]
It seems obvious that the optimum angle is independent of the radius
of the sheet metal, so let's call it \(R\) instead of 10 meters.  (We
could call it 1, but you may not trust your insight enough to be so
daring.)

$BR We need to express \(r\) and \(h\) in terms of \(\theta\).
Cutting out a sector with angle \(theta\) leaves a part of the
circumference of length \[L=(2\pi - \theta)R = \beta R \] where
\(\beta = 2\pi - \theta\) is the angle that the remaining sheet metal
makes at the center of the original circle.



$BR The remaining part of the circumference forms the circumference of
the base of the cone.  Thus \[r =\frac{\beta}{2\pi} R.\]

The silhouette of the cone is an isosceles triangle where the base
equals \(2r\) and the other sides equal R.  The height therefore, is
\[h = \sqrt{R^2-r^2} = R \sqrt{1-\frac{\beta^2}{4\pi^2}}.\]

Hence the volume of the tank is given by \[V = \frac{
R^3}{12\pi^2}\beta^2\sqrt{1-\frac{\beta^2}{4\pi^2}}.\] $BR To maximize
this expression we need to maximize \[\alpha(\beta) =
\beta^2\sqrt{1-\frac{\beta^2}{4\pi^2}}.\] As expected, \(R\) is
irrelevant.  Moreover, we can multiply with \(2\pi\) to simplify, and
get: \[\gamma(\beta) = 2\pi \alpha (\beta) =
\beta^2\sqrt{4\pi^2-\beta^2}.\]

The same value of \(\beta\) maximizes \(\gamma\) and \(\alpha\), so wee
need to find the critical values \(\gamma\).  It's geometrically clear
that the point of interest is a stationary point in the interval
\((0,2\pi)\).  Thus we differentiate \(\gamma\) and set the derivative
equal to zero:

\[\gamma'(\beta) = 2\beta\sqrt{4\pi^2-\beta^2}-\frac{\beta^3}{\sqrt{4\pi^2-\beta^2}} = 0.\]
After dividing by \(\beta\) and multiplying with \(\sqrt{4\pi^2-\beta^2}\) this turns into
\[2(4\pi^2-\beta^2) - \beta^2 = 0\]
which simplifies to 
\[3\beta^2 = 8 \pi^2.\]
Dividing by \(3\)  and taking the square root gives
\[\beta = \frac{\sqrt{8}}{\sqrt{3}}\pi.\]
Finally, we obtain 
\[\theta = 2\pi - \beta = \left(2\pi - \frac{\sqrt{8}}{\sqrt{3}}\right) \pi \approx 1.153 \hbox{~radians}.\]
$BR
The question did not ask for this, but this is approximately 66.06
degrees, which seems reasonable.
$BR The questions also did not ask for the volume either, but since
we've come so far we may as well compute it.  Substituting our value
of \(\beta\) and \(R=10) into the volume formula above we obtain


\[V = \frac{
R^3}{12\pi^2}\beta^2\sqrt{1-\frac{\beta^2}{4\pi^2}}\approx
403\hbox{~cubic meters}.\] This is roughly the volume of a cube
with a side of 7.4 feet, which also seems reasonable.

$BR One can actually simplify things a little, and recognize more
details.  You may want to do this as an exercise.  It turns out that
\[r=\frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}R, \quad h = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}R, \quad r =
\sqrt{2}h,\quad\hbox{and}\quad V= \frac{2\sqrt{3}\pi R^3}{27}.\]

If you wish to draw the cone, to see if it looks reasonable, use

\[r \approx 8.165\hbox{m} \quad\hbox{and}\quad h = 5.774\hbox{m}.\]

That cone may look a little lower
than expected, but note that the
parts far from the axis of the cone
contribute much more to the volume
that those close to the axis, and
so you want to have a cone with a
large radius and a comparatively
small height.
