This is a variation of problem 10 on page 141 of our textbook.  You
may want to solve this problem only after you solve the next one,
which is the general version of this one.  On the other hand, you also
may want to solve this one first, and when solving the general one
compare your evolving solution against your results in this problem.
$BR
A child is flying a kite. If the kite is $h feet above the child's hand
level and the wind is blowing it on a horizontal course at $v feet per
second, the child is paying out cord at
\{&ans_rule(15)\} feet per second
when $s feet of cord are
out.  Assume that the cord remains straight from hand to kite.  (If
you have ever flown a kite you know that this is an unrealistic
assumption.)
$BR For a solution of this problem (after the set closes) see the 
next problem.
EOT
&ANS( num_cmp(sqrt($s*$s-$h*$h)*$v/$s));
