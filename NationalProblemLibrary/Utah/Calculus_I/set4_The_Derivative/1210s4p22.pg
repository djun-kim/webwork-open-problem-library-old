TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
As discussed in class (and in the textbook on pages 192--194), to solve
the equation \[f(x) = 0 \] by $BITALIC Newton's Method$EITALIC we start with a
good initial guess \(x_0\) and then run the iteration \[x_{n+1} = x_n
- \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}, \quad n=0,1,2,\ldots\] until we get an
approximation \(x_{n+1}\) that is good enough for our purposes.

$BR

Suppose you want to compute the cube root of 4 by solving the equation
\[x^3-4 = 0.\]
Since \(1^3=1\) and \(2^3=8\) Let's start with 
\[x_0 = 1.5\]
Then
$BR
\(x_1 = \) \{ans_rule(10) \},
EOT

&ANS(num_cmp(43/27,reltol => 0.001));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
\(x_2 = \) \{ans_rule(10) \}, 
EOT

&ANS(num_cmp(237746/149769,reltol => 0.001));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
\(x_3 = \) \{ans_rule(10) \}, and
EOT
&ANS(num_cmp(1.587401052,reltol => 0.001));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR To check your answer compute 
\(x_3^3 = \) \{ans_rule(10) \}.

$BR  Enter \(x_1\), \(x_2\) and \(x_3\) with at least
6 correct digits beyond the decimal point.
