The purpose of this problem is to help you prepare for exam 2.
There will be 8 problems on the exam, covering the following areas:

$BR

$BR A related rates problem.

$BR Finding critical points and extreme values.  For example,
the function \[f(x)=-x(x^2-1)\] has two stationary points.  The smaller is
 \{&ans_rule(20)\} and the larger
EOT

&ANS( num_cmp(-1/sqrt(3)));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
is  \{&ans_rule(20)\}. The maximum value of \(f\) in the interval
\([0,1]\) is 
EOT

&ANS( num_cmp( 1/sqrt(3)));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
 \{&ans_rule(20)\}.
EOT
&ANS( num_cmp( 1/sqrt(3)*2/3));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

 $BR Drawing graphs.  For example, draw the graph
of the function in the preceding problem.

$BR Use of derivatives to determine where a function is increasing
and where it is decreasing.

$BR (Simple) Word problems involving minimization and maximization.

$BR The Mean Value Theorem.
