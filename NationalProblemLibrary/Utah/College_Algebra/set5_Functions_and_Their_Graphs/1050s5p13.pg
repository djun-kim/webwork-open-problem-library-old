TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

The domain of the function
\[ f(x) = \frac{x+4}{x+2} \]
is the set of all real number except 
$BR
 \{ ans_rule(18) \} and its range is the set of all numbers except
EOT

&ANS( num_cmp(-2));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
 \{ ans_rule(18) \},
EOT
&ANS( num_cmp(1));

$BR $BBOLD Hint: $EBOLD
To find the domain observe that we can't divide by zero.  To find the
range solve an equation.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Since we denominator is zero when \(x=-2\)
the domain is the set of all real numbers other than \(-2\).  As
discussed in class, to find the range we solve the equatiuon
\[\frac{x+4}{x+2} = y \] for \(x\).
Multiplying with \((x+2)\) gives
\[x+4 = y(x+2) = yx + 2y.\]
This can be reqwritten as
\[x-yx = 2y -4\]
or
\[(1-y)x = 2y-4.\]
Thus
\[x = \frac{2y-4}{1-y}\]
which is defined for all \(y\) except \[y = 1.\]
