This problem differs from the preceding one only in the right hand side.
You have already done many of the necessary calculations and don't need to redo them if you have good notes for your solution of the previous problem.

\begin{array}{rrrcl}
x & + y &+z & =& 1 \\

$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD Proceed as described in
class, guarding against errors by using row sums.  I would express the
solution as fractions rather than decimal approximations.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
The calculations are summarized in the following table.  The numbers
of the equations are enclosed in parentheses.  For clarity zero entries are left blank.  The table is the same as before, except that the columns headed RHS and RS are different.
\[
\begin{array}{lrrrrr}
\hbox{Number} & x & y & z & \hbox{RHS} & \hbox{RS} \\
(1)              & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 4 \\
(2)              & 1 & 2 &-1 & 2 & 4 \\
(3)              & 1 &-3 & 2 & 3 & 3 \\
(4) = (2) - (1)  &   & 1 &-2 & 1 & 0 \\
(5) = (3) - (1)  &   &-4 & 1 & 2 & -1 \\
(6) = (5)+4(4)   &   &   & -7& 6 & -1 \\
\end{array}
\]

Equation \((6)\) reads \(-7z= 6\) and hence 
\[z = -\frac{6}{7}.\]
This turns equation \((5)\) into 
\(-4y -\frac{6}{7} = 2\) and so 
\[y =  -5/7\]
From the first equation we obtain
\(x-\frac{5}{7}-\frac{6}{7}=1\) and so
\[x=\frac{18}{7}.\]

Substituting in the original equations shows that this is the correct solution.
