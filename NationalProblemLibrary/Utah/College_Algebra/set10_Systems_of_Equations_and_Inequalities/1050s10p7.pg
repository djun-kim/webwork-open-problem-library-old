TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 


On the
\{htmlLink("http://www.pgc.nrcan.gc.ca/seismo/eqinfo/richter.htm",
"Richter Scale")\}, the magnitude \(R\) of an earthquake of intensity
\(I\) is \[R = \log_{10}\frac{I}{I_0}\] where \(I_0\) is a reference
intensity.

$BR

During the semester break, at 7:23am on March 19, 2003, an earthquake
measuring 3.0 on the Richter scale occurred near the town of Nephi.  An
earthquake of that magnitude is often felt, but rarely causes damage.
$BR 
By comparison, the earthquake that struck San Francisco in 1906
measured 8.25 on the Richter scale.  It was
 \{ ans_rule(10) \} times as intensive as the recent Nephi earthquake.

EOT

&ANS( strict_num_cmp(10**5.25));



SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD We just need to evaluate
\[\frac{10^{8.25}}{10^3}=10^{5.25}\approx 177,828.\]
