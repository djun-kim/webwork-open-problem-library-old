TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 

I can't resist the temptation to include this little real life word
problem.  I'm sure you have had the experience that you listen to
somebody talking about a lot of stuff that you don't understand, but
making a clear mistake in a subject that you do understand. It makes
you wonder about the whole rest of the presentation.

$PAR $BITALIC The British government on Thursday estimated the cost of 
hosting
the 2012 Olympics in London at 9.3 billion pounds, nearly four times
initial projections.  When Britain won the Olympics in 2005, the Games
were expected to cost 2.4 billion pounds.

$PAR Actually, the projections increased by 
  \{ ans_rule(25) \} percent, not 400$PERCENT.
