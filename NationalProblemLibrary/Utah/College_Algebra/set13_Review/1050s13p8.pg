$BBOLD Graphing. $EBOLD
Understand the interplay between algebra and geometry when graphs are shifted horizontally and vertically.

$BR
For example, the graph of \[f(x) = e^{x-2}-3\]
is the graph of the exponential \(y=e^x\) shifted 
 \{ ans_rule(10) \} units horizontally and
EOT
&ANS(num_cmp(2));


TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
\{ ans_rule(10) \} units vertically.  (Distinguish left and right and
up and down with the appropriate signs of the shift.  You should also
draw the graphs of the original and the shifted exponential in one
coordinate system.)
EOT
&ANS(num_cmp(-3));
