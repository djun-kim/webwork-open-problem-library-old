TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
$BBOLD Equations of straight lines and graphs of linear equations. $EBOLD
Know how to obtain an equation of a straight line given two pieces of
information, for example, two points, or a point and slope.
Intercepts lead to special cases of points.

$BR

Let \(L\) be the line through the points \((1,-2)\) and \((-2,-3)\).
The slope of \(L\) is
\{ ans_rule(10) \}.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(1/3));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
Using \(x\) and \(y\) as the variables as usual, its equation in 
slope intercept form is
\(y=\)  \{ ans_rule(10) \}.

EOT
ANS(fun_cmp("1/3*x-7/3", [[0,5]], vars=>["x"]));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
The \(x\)-intercept of \(L\) is
\(x=\)  \{ ans_rule(10) \}.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(7));
