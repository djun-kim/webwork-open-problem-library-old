The next few problems are simple word problems that illustrate the 
key aspect of exponential growth.

$BR

$BBOLD In any time interval of a given length, the function value is 
multiplied by the same factor. $EBOLD

$BR

The first problem reviews a discussion we had in class.

$BR

You invest money a at certain annual interest rate \(p\).  Interest is
paid once a year.  We have discussed this problem before, and will now examine
it in more depth.  It is customary to use instead of the percentage the rate 
\(r\) defined by 
\[r = \frac{p}{100}.\]
$BR

$BR Every year you multiply your current capital by a factor
 \{ ans_rule(10) \} (where your answer of course  depends on \(r\)).
EOT

&ANS( multivar_function_cmp("1+r", ["r"],[[1,2]]));



TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
$BR In \(2\) years you multiply your initial capital with 
 \{ ans_rule(10) \}.
EOT
&ANS( multivar_function_cmp("(1+r)**2", ["r"],[[1,2]]));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
$BR In \(3\) years you multiply your initial capital with 
 \{ ans_rule(10) \}.
EOT
&ANS( multivar_function_cmp("(1+r)**3", ["r"],[[1,2]]));


TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
$BR In \(t\) years you multiply your initial capital with 
 \{ ans_rule(10) \} (where your answer depends on \(r\) and \(t\).
EOT
&ANS( multivar_function_cmp("(1+r)**t", ["r","t"],[[1,2],[1,2]]));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
$BR Supposing that your initial deposit is \(I\), after
\(t\) years, your balance is
$BR
\(f(t)\) =
 \{ ans_rule(10) \} (where your answer depends on \(r\), \(t\), and \(I\).
(Remember that variables are case sensitive, you do need to use the proper upper or lower case for each variable.)
$BR
EOT
&ANS( multivar_function_cmp("(1+r)**t*I", ["r","t","I"],[[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]));





SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD 
As we discussed in 
class, in \(t\) years you multiply your initial capital with \((1+r)^t\) 
so that if \(I\) is your initial investment, after \(t\) years it has 
grown to \[f(t) = (1+r)^tI.\]
