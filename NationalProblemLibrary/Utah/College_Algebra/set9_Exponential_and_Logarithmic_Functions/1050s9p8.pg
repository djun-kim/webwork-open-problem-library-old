TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 

Let \(t\) denote time measured in years, with \(t=0\) corresponding to
the year 2004.  Let \(P\) be the world population at the beginning of
this year.  If the world population \(p(t)\) were to obey
the formula \[p(t) = Pe^{0.012t} \]
then the annual growth rate would be
\{ ans_rule(10) \} percent, and it would take
EOT
ANS(num_cmp((exp(0.012)-1)*100, mode=>"strict"));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
\{ ans_rule(10) \} years for the population to double.

Again, remember to enter your answer with a total of about four digits.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(log(2)/0.012, mode=>"strict"));

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD After one year the population is multiplied by the factor
\[e^{0.012}\approx 1.0120722.\]
Subtract \(1\) and multiply with \(100\) to see that this corresponds to a growth rate of \(1.207\) percent. 
To find the doubling time we need to solve the equation
\[e^{0.012}t = 2.\]
Taking the natural logarithm and dividing by \(0.012\) gives the doubling time:
\[t = \frac{ln 2}{0,012} \approx 57.76 \hbox{years}.\]
