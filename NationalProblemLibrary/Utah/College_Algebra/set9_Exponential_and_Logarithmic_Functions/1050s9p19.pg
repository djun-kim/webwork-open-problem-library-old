TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 

For the following statements write T if they are true, and 
F if they are false.  To avoid cumbersome sentences it is tacitly
understood that logarithms have the same base, and are applied to the
appropriate terms.  We also assume that all logarithms are evaluated
at positive numbers.
$BR
For example, a more precise version of the first
sentence would be: The logarithm with a certain base of the product of
two positive numbers equals the sum of the logarithms with the same base of
those two numbers.

$BR

$BR \{ans_rule(10)\} The logarithm of a product equals the sum of
the logarithms.

EOT
&ANS(str_cmp("T"));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
$BR \{ans_rule(10)\} The logarithm of a quotient equals the
difference of the logarithms.
EOT
&ANS(str_cmp("T"));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 

$BR \{ans_rule(10)\} The logarithm of a power equals the product of
the exponent and the logarithm of the base (of the power).

$BR
EOT
&ANS(str_cmp("T"));
