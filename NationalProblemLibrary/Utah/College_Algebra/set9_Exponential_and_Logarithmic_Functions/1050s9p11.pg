TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 


Remember from the last home work set that the largest currently known
prime number is \[P = 2^{$p}-1.\]

$BR
Previously you computed the number of decimal digits of \(P\).
Suppose you wish to express \(P\) in the binary system used by
computers, where the base is \(2\) instead of \(10\), and the only
possible digits are \(0\) and \(1\).  The number of binary digits is
\{ ans_rule(15) \}.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp($p, tol => 0.5, mode => 'strict'));


TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR Hint: In the binary system,
\[2^2-1 = \underline{11}, \quad\hbox{and}\quad 2^3-1 = \underline{111}\]
where the underscores indicate binary digits.
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Evidently the number of binary digits of \(2^k-1\) is \(k\), so the number of binary digits of \(P\) is \($p\). They are all equal to \(1\).
