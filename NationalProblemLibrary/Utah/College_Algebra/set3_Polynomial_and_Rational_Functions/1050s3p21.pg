The remaining problems of this set all lead to quadratic equations
that you are asked to solve.  WeBWorK will accept numerical answers,
but you should be able to produce exact answers, for example using
square roots.  In other words, don't just key the equation into your
calculator and transfer the numerical values.

The equation

\[x^2 - 3x -10 = 0\]
has two solutions. The smaller is \{ ans_rule(5) \}, and the larger
