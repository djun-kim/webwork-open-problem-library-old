TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

This and the next few problems are exercises in writing rational
expressions in standard form.  You are asked to enter the numerator
and denominator as polynomials.  For example, since we carry out
divisions by increasing length of the fraction bar (as discussed in
class), \[\frac{~\frac{a}{b}~}{c} = \frac{a}{bc},\] and so you would
enter \(a\) as the numerator and \(bc\) as the denominator.  Try it
now: 

$BR
\(\displaystyle\frac{~\frac{a}{b}~}{c} = \) \{ ans_rule(3) \} \(/\)
EOT

&ANS( multivar_function_cmp( "a", ["a","b","c"], [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
) );

 \{ ans_rule(3) \}.

&ANS( multivar_function_cmp( "bc", ["a","b","c"], [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]] ) );
