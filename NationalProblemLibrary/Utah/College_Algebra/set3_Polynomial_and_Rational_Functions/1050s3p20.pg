TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

There's a pond in your village.  Somebody plants a water lily in it
that doubles its size every day.  While you are off on a vacation the
lily grows by a factor $n.  Your vacation was \{ ans_rule(5) \} days
long.  (Note: this problem foreshadows one of our major topics in this
class, i.e., $BBOLD logarithms$EBOLD.  It does not require logarithms for its
solution, however.)

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Let \(d\) be the number of days that passed.
We need to solve the equation 
\[2^d = $n.\]
Examining the powers of 2,
\[ 2,~4,~8,~16,~32,~64,~128,~256,~512,~1024\]
we see that \[d=$d\].
