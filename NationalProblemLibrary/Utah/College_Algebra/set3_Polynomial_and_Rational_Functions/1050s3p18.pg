TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
You invest $DOLLAR $A.  Your banker tells you that your investment will
double in exactly $d years.  At your next party you tell your friends
that you invested money (you modestly omit the amount) at 
\{ans_rule(20) \}  percent annual interest.  (Enter your percentage with
at least three digits beyond the decimal point.)

&ANS( num_cmp((2**(1/$d)-1)*100));

$a = (int((2**(1/$d)-1)*100)*1000)/1000;

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD  Write down an equation in \(p\) and take both sides to a suitable power.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
We have to solve the equation
\[\left(1+\frac{p}{100}\right)^{$d} = 2.\]
Tanking both sides to the power \(\frac{1}{d}\), subtracting 1, and multiplying with 100 gives the answer:

\[p = 100 \left(2^{\frac{1}{$d}}-1\right) \approx $a $DOLLAR.\]
