TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

The next few problems deal with interest earning investments.  If your
money earns \(p\) percent interest per year then at the end of the
year your money is multiplied with the factor
\(\left(1+\frac{p}{100}\right)\).  (The interest is paid annually---at
this stage we ignore subtleties like paying interest every month.)

$BR


You invest $DOLLAR $A at $p $PERCENT annual interest. 
After ten years you have $DOLLAR  \{ ans_rule(20) \} in the Bank.

&ANS( num_cmp($A*(1+$p/100)**10));
