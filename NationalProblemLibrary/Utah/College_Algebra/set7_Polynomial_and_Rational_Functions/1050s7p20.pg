TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 

The next three problems once again concern quadratic equations.
Enter them in the form 
u+/-v S
where "S" is the letter "i" if the solution is a conjugate complex pair, and it is the digit "1" if the solutions are real.

$BR
For example, if the solution is 3/2 +/- sqrt(5) i, say, you would enter
"3/2", "sqrt(5)", and "i".  If the solution is 2 +/- 1 you would enter
"2", "1", and "1".  If there is only one solution, say 3, you would
enter it a bit ponderously as "3", "0", "1".
$BR
The solution of the quadratic equation 
\[x^2+2x+2 = 0\]
is
\(x = \)  \{ ans_rule(10) \}  \(+/-\)
EOT
&ANS( num_cmp(-1));

EOT
&ANS( num_cmp(1));
