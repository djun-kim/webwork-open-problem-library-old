One solution of the
the equation
\[p(x)= x^4-9x^3+30x^2-33x-13 = 0\]

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Since \(3-2i\) is a zero of \(p\), so is its conjugate complex, \(3+2i\).
Hence we can divide \(p\) by the quadratic factor
\[\big(x-(3-2i)\big) \big(x-(3+2i)\big)  = x^2-6x+13.\]
Long division shows
\[p(x) = ( x^2-6x+13)(x^2-3x-1).\]
The zeros of the second factor are
\[x=\frac{3}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{13}}{2}.\]
