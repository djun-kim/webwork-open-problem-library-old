TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
A line can be defined $BITALIC in general form $EITALIC by the equation
\[Ax+By = C\]
where \(A\), \(B\) and \(C\) are constants.
You may assume that both \(A\) and \(B\) are non-zero.
Then the slope of the line is
\{ ans_rule(5) \},
EOT

&ANS( multivar_function_cmp( "-A/B", ["A","B","C"], [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]));

its \(x\) intercept is 
\{ ans_rule(5) \},

and its \(y\) intercept is  \{ ans_rule(5) \}.  Of course your answers will depend
on \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\).  Remember that mathematics, and WeBWorK,
are case sensitive, so make sure to use upper case letters A, B and C.
