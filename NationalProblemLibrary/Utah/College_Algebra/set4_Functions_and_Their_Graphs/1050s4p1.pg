The first few problems are exercises in solving inequalities and using
interval notation, as described in sections A1 and A6 of the
textbook.  For example, the set of inequalities \[ -1 < x\leq 3\]
describes the interval \((-1,3]\) Enter that interval by typing a
round opening parenthesis, the number -1, the number 3, and a
square closing parenthesis in the following four answer fields:

$BR
 \{ ans_rule(3) \}
EOT

&ANS( str_cmp("("));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
 \{ ans_rule(18) \},
EOT
&ANS( num_cmp(-1));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
 \{ ans_rule(18) \}
EOT
&ANS( num_cmp(3));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
 \{ ans_rule(3) \}.  
$BR
In this problem, WeBWorK will tell for each
answer individually if it is correct, so you can check what you are
doing.  In the following problems you will need to get all answers
right before getting credit.  
EOT
&ANS( str_cmp("]"));
