Jessica borrowed  $DOLLAR$A  from the bank in order to buy a new
piano. She will pay it off by equal payments at the end of each week
for 2 years. The interest rate is \( $r% \) compounded
weekly. Determine the size of payments, and the total interest paid.

Payments:  $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(30)\}

Total interest:  $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(30)\}
