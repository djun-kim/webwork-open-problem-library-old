TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
As a hardworking student, plagued by too much homework, you spend all night
doing math homework.  By 6am, you imagine yourself to be a region bounded by $BR
\(y = $a x^2\) $BR
\(x=0\) $BR
\(x=$b\) $BR
\(y=0\) $BR
As you grow more and more tired, the world begins to spin around you.  However,
according to Newton, there is no difference between the world spinning around
you, and you spinning around the world. Unfortunately, you are so tired that
you think the world is the x-axis. What is the volume of the solid you (the
region) create by spinning about the x-axis?$BR
\{ans_rule(45)\}

$answer = $pi*$a**2*.2*$b**5;
