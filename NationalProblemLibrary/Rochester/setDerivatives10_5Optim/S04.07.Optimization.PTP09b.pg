BEGIN_TEXT

A small island is $a miles from the nearest point P on the straight
shoreline of a large lake.  If a woman on the island can row a boat
$row miles per hour and can walk $walk miles per hour, where should
the boat be landed in order to arrive at a town $b miles down the
shore from P in the least time?  Let \( x \) be the distance (in miles) between
point P and where the boat lands on the lakeshore.

(A) Enter a function \( T(x) \) that describes the total amount of
time (in hours) the trip takes as a function of the distance \( x \).
$BR
\( T(x) \) = \{ans_rule(30)\}
$BR$BR


(B) What is the distance \( x = c \) that minimizes the travel time?
Note: The answer to this problem requires that you enter the correct
\{ helpLink('units') \}.

$BR 
\( c \) = \{ans_rule(25)\}.  
$BR$BR 


(C) What is the least travel time?  Note: The answer to this problem
requires that you enter the correct \{ helpLink('units') \}.

$BR
The least travel time is \{ans_rule(25)\}.

# (D) Recall that the second derivative test says that if \( T'(c) = 0
# \) and \( T''(c) > 0 \), then \( T \) has a local minimum at \( c. \)
# What is \( T''(c) \)?
# $BR
# \( T''(c) \) = \{ans_rule(25)\}
