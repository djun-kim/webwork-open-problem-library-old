BEGIN_TEXT

The manager of a large apartment complex knows from experience that
$max_rooms units will be occupied if the rent is $min_rent dollars per
month. A market survey suggests that, on the average, one additional
unit will remain vacant for each $demand_rate dollar increase in rent.
Similarly, one additional unit will be occupied for each $demand_rate
dollar decrease in rent.  What rent should the manager charge to
maximize revenue?  \{ ans_rule(30) \} dollars.

ANS(num_cmp($optimum_rent, format=>"%0.2f", tol=>0.01,tolType=>"absolute"));

# set the absolute tolerance to 0.01 so that the answer 
# must be correct to the nearest penny.
