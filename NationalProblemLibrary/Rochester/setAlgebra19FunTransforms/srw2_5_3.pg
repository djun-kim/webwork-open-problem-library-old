BEGIN_TEXT
The graph of the function 
\( y = $a f(x) \)
can be obtained from the graph of
\( y = f(x) \)
by one of the following actions:
$BR
(a) horizontally stretching the graph of \(f(x)\) by a factor $a;
$BR
(b) horizontally shrinking the graph of \(f(x)\) by a factor $a;
$BR
(c) vertically stretching the graph of \(f(x)\) by a factor $a;
$BR
(d) vertically shrinking the graph of \(f(x)\) by a factor $a;
$BR
Your answer is (input a, b, c, or d) \{ans_rule(15) \}
$BR
