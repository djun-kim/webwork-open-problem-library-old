BEGIN_TEXT

Consider \(n=$n\) independent flips of a fair coin. Say that a changeover occurs whenever an outcome differs from the one preceding it. For
example, if \(n=6\) and the outcome is \( T \ H \ T \ T \ H \ T, \) then there is a total of \(4\) changeorvers. Find the expected number of
changeovers for  \(n=$n.\)
