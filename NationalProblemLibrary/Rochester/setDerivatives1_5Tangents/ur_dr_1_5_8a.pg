On a separate piece of paper, sketch the graph of the parabola \( y = x^2 + $a1 \).  On the same graph, plot the point \( (0, -$b1 )\).  Note that there are two tangent lines of \( y = x^2 + $a1 \) that pass through the point \( (0, -$b1 )\).
$BR
$PAR
Specifically, the tangent line of the parabola \( y = x^2 + $a1 \) at the point \( (a, a^2 + $a1) \) passes through the point \( (0, -$b1 )\) where \( a > 0 \).  The other tangent line that passes through the point \( (0, -$b1 )\) occurs at the point \( (-a, a^2 + $a1) \).

Find the number \( a \).
