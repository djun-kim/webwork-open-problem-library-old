Let \( h(x) = $f  \), 
$PAR
\( h'( $x1 ) = \)
\{ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR

Use this to find the equation of the tangent line to the curve
 \( y = $f  \)
at the point \( ( $x1 , $y1 ) \) and write your answer in the form:
$PAR
\( y = mx+b \), where  \( m \)  is the slope and  \( b \)  is the y-intercept.
