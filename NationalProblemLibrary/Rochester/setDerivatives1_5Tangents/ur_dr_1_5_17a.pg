Let \( f(x) =$b-x^2 \)
$BR
The slope of the tangent line to the graph of \( f(x) \) at the point \( (-$x,$y) \) is \{ans_rule(10)\}.
$BR
The equation of the tangent line to the graph of \( f(x) \) at \( (-$x,$y) \) is \( y=mx+b \) for
$BR
\( m=\)\{ans_rule(10)\}$BR
and
$BR
\( b=\)\{ans_rule(10)\}.$BR
Hint: the slope is given by the derivative at \(x=-$x\), ie.
$BR
\( \displaystyle{
       \lim_{x\to-$x}\frac{f(-$x+h)-f(-$x)}{h}} \)
