An algebra class has $kids students and $kids desks.  For the sake of variety, 
students change the seating arrangement each day.  How many days must pass 
before the class must repeat a seating arrangement?

\{ans_rule(15)\} days must pass before a seating arrangement is repeated.

Suppose the desks are arranged in rows of 4.  How many seating arrangements are
there that put Larry, Moe, Curly, and Shemp in the front seats?

There are \{ans_rule(15)\} seating arrangements that put them in the front 
seats.

The probability is \{ans_rule(15)\}.
