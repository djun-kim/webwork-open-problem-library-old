Solve the following inequality. Write the answer in interval notation. 
$BBOLD Note: $EBOLD
If the answer includes more than one interval write the intervals separated by the "union" symbol, U. 
If needed enter \(\infty\) as $BITALIC infinity $EITALIC and \(-\infty \) as $BITALIC -infinity $EITALIC .
\[ (x-$a)(x-$b)>0 \]
$BR
Answer: \{ans_rule(35)\}

$ans1 = $a;
$ans2 = $b;
ANS(interval_cmp("(-infinity,$ans1)U($ans2,infinity)"));
