Solve the following inequality. Write the answer in interval notation. 
$BBOLD Note: $EBOLD
If the answer includes more than one interval write the intervals separated by the "union" symbol, U. 
If needed enter \(\infty\) as $BITALIC infinity $EITALIC and \(-\infty \) as $BITALIC -infinity $EITALIC .
\[ 4|x+$a| -$b < $c \]
$BR
Answer:  \{ans_rule(40)\}

$ans1 = -($b+$c)/4-$a;
$ans2 =  ($b+$c)/4-$a;
ANS(interval_cmp("($ans1,$ans2)"));
