$a =  random(1,20,1);
$b =  random(1,20,1);

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Solve the following inequality. Write the answer in interval notation.
$BBOLD Note: $EBOLD
If the answer includes more than one interval write the intervals separated by the "union" symbol, U. 
If needed enter \(\infty\) as $BITALIC infinity $EITALIC and \(-\infty \) as $BITALIC -infinity $EITALIC .
\[ 3x + $a \le 6x + $b \]
$BR
Answer: \{ans_rule(20)\}
EOT

$ans1 = ($a-$b)/3;

ANS(interval_cmp("[$ans1,infinity)"));
