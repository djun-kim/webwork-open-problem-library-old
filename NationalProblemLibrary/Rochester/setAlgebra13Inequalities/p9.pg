Solve the following inequality. Write the answer in interval notation.
$BR
$BBOLD Note: $EBOLD
If the answer includes more than one interval write the intervals separated by
the "union" symbol, U. If needed enter \(\infty \) as $BITALIC infinity $EITALIC and \(-\infty \) as $BITALIC -infinity $EITALIC .
$BR
\[ |x-$a| \ge $b  \]
