A hot-air balloon is floating above a straight road.  To calculate their
height above the ground, the balloonists simultaneously measure the angle
of depression to two consecutive mileposts on the road on the same side
of the balloon.  The angles of depression are found to be
\( $a1 ^\circ \) and \( $a2 ^\circ \). $BR How high (in feet) is the ballon?
\{ans_rule(25) \}
$BR

$ans = $h1;

$HINT
1. Did you convert miles into feet?
$BR
2. Did you convert degrees to radians?
