This problem demonstrates how WeBWorK handles numerical answers
involving units.  WeBWorK can handle all units that are used in
elementary physics courses.  Click on \{ helpLink('units') \} for a
list of units that WeBWorK accepts. $PAR

Two perpendicular sides of a triangle are $fx m and $fy m long
respectively.  What is the length of the third side of the triangle?
You can answer this in terms of m's, cm's, km's, in's, ft, etc. but
you must enter the units.  If you don't remember the Pythagorean
theorem, check "Show Hint" and then "Submit Answer"

$PAR One side of a rectangle is 5 ft long and the other is 4 ft long.
The area of the rectangle is \{ans_rule(40) \}  (Remember to square
the units.)
