The polynomial \($c1 x^3 + $c2 x^2 + $c3 x + $c4 \) can be factored into
the product of three polynomials, \(A \cdot B \cdot C\) 
where the constant term of \(A\) is
less than or equal to the constant term of \(B\) which is less than or equal to
the constant term of \(C\).  Find \(A, B\) and \(C\).
