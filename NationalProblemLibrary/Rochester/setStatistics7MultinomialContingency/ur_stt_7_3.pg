BEGIN_TEXT
It has been suggusted that the highest priority of retirees is travel.  Thus, a study was conducted
to investigate the differences in the length of stay of a trip for pre and postretirees.  A sample
of \($n\) travelers were asked how long they stayed on a typical trip.  The observed results of the
study are found below. $BR
\{begintable(4)\}
\{row("Number of Nights", "Pre-retirement", "Post-retirement", "Total")\}
\{row("\(4-7\)", "\($x[0]\)", "\($y[0]\)", "\($xy[0]\)")\}
\{row("\(8-13\)", "\($x[1]\)", "\($y[1]\)", "\($xy[1]\)")\}
\{row("\(14-21\)", "\($x[2]\)", "\($y[2]\)", "\($xy[2]\)")\}
\{row("\(22\) or more", "\($x[3]\)", "\($y[3]\)", "\($xy[3]\)")\}
\{row("Total", "\($totx\)", "\($toty\)", "\($n\)")\}
\{endtable()\}
$BR
With this information, construct a table of estimated expected values. $BR
\{begintable(3)\}
\{row("Number of Nights", "Pre-retirement", "Post-retirement")\}
\{row("\(4-7\)", ans_rule(10), ans_rule(10))\}
\{row("\(8-13\)", ans_rule(10), ans_rule(10))\}
\{row("\(14-21\)", ans_rule(10), ans_rule(10))\}
\{row("\(22\) or more", ans_rule(10), ans_rule(10))\}
\{endtable()\}
$BR
Now, with that information, determine whether the length of stay is independent of retirement using
\(\alpha = $alpha\) $PAR
\(\chi^2 =\) \{ans_rule(20)\} $PAR
rejection region is \(\chi^2 > \) \{ans_rule(20)\}
