Here is a little more review concerning trig functions.  Using the formula for sin() and cos()
of the  sum of two angles.  See page 190-191 in Boyce and Diprima for relevant examples, and your
calculus book for the formula.

Now reverse this formula and given the expanded version find the version with just one term.
This involves solving a pair of equations -- $BR
in order to get \( A\cos(x) + B\sin(x) = R\sin(x+b) = R\sin(b)\cos(x)  + R\cos(b)\sin(x)    \)
what values must you choose for \( R \) and \( b \)? (Match coefficients.)
$BR
(Hint: see page 190, equations 16 and 17 for an example.) $PAR By convention we'll assume that the
amplitude (the first coefficient on the left hand side) is positive.
$PAR
 \{ans_rule(7)\}\(\cos(${a} x + \) \{ans_rule(7)\}\(  ) = \) $A\(\cos(${a}x)\) + $B\( \sin(${a}x ) \)
$PAR
 \{ans_rule(7)\}\(\sin(${c} x + \) \{ans_rule(7)\} \( ) = \) $C\(\cos(${c}x)\) + $D\( \sin(${c}x ) \)
$PAR

The upshot of this exercise is that we can always rewrite the sum of  multiples of  sin() and  cos() as a single
sin() function with a given amplitude and phase shift. We could also write it as a single cos(), but it would have a different
phase in that case.  We'll use this many times in interpreting results.
