# We need a special problem grader on this problem, since we
# want the first three answer blanks to count for about 17% each,
# while the fourth counts for the remaining 50%.  To change these
# percentages, look through the following mess of code for the
# places .16, .17, .17, and .50 appear, and change those.
# Also change the long line beginning "msg ==>", to show what will
# appear on the screen for the student.
#
# To look at the problem itself, look for the next one of these
# boxed comments.
