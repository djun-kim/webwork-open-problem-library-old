BEGIN_TEXT
A company that makes thing-a-ma-bobs has a start up cost of $DOLLAR $a.  It costs the company $DOLLAR $b to make each
thing-a-ma-bob.  The company charges $DOLLAR $c for each thing-a-ma-bob.  Let
\(x\) denote the number of thing-a-ma-bobs produced.
        $BR $BR 
Write the cost function for this company.
        \(C(x)\) = \{ans_rule(40)\}
        $BR $BR 
Write the revenue function for this company.
        \(R(x)\) = \{ans_rule(40)\}
        $BR $BR 
What is the minumum number of thing-a-ma-bobs that the company must produce and sell to make a profit?
        \{ans_rule(40)\}
