BEGIN_TEXT
For the graph of the equation \(y=$a x+$b\), draw a sketch of the graph on
a piece of paper. Then answer the following questions:
$BR $BR
The \(x\)-intercept is : \{ans_rule(10)\}, The \(y\)-intercept is : \{ans_rule(10)\}
$BR 
Is the graph symmetric with respect to the \(x\)-axis? 
Input yes or no here : \{ans_rule(10)\}
$BR 
Is the graph symmetric with respect to the \(y\)-axis? 
Input yes or no here : \{ans_rule(10)\}
$BR 
Is the graph symmetric with respect to the origin? 
Input yes or no here : \{ans_rule(10)\}
