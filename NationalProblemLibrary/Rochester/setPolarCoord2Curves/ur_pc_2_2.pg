A curve with polar equation 

\[r=\frac{$n }{$a \sin \theta+$b \cos \theta}\]
represents a line.  This line has a  Cartesian equation  of the form $BR

\( y = mx + b \) ,where \( m \) and \( b \) are constants.  Give the formula $BR
for \( y \)  in terms of \( x \).  For example, if the line had equation $BR
\( y = 2x+3 \) then the answer would be \( 2*x + 3 \) .
