If  \( f(\theta) \) is given by:  \(f(\theta) = $a \cos^3 \theta \)
and \( g(\theta) \) is given by: \(g(\theta) = $a \sin^3 \theta \) $BR
Find the total length of the astroid described by \( f(\theta)\) and \( g(\theta)\). $BR
(The astroid is the curve swept out by \( (f(\theta),g(\theta)) \) as \( \theta \) 
ranges from \( 0 \) to \( 2\pi.\) ) $BR
