BEGIN_TEXT
A roasted turkey is taken from an oven when its temperature has reached
185 Fahrenheit and is placed on a table in a room where the temperature is 75
Fahrenheit.
$BR
(a) If the temperature of the turkey is $a Fahrenheit after half an hour,
    what is its temperature after 45 minutes?
$BR
Your answer is \{ans_rule(15) \} Fahrenheit.

(b) When will the trukey cool to 100 Fahrenheit?
$BR
Your answer is \{ans_rule(15) \} hours.
