BEGIN_TEXT

The Deligne Dam on the Cayley River is built so that the
wall facing the water is shaped like the region above the curve
\( y=$a x^2  \) and below the line \( y= $b \).  (Here, distances
are measured in meters.)  The water level is \( $c \) meters
below the top of the dam.  Find the force (in Newtons) exerted
on the dam by water pressure.  (Water has a density of
\(1000 kg/m^3\), and the acceleration of gravity is
\(9.8 m/sec^2\) .)
