Consider the function \( f(x) = $a1 -$b1 x^2 \) on the interval \( [ $c1 , $d1 ] \).
Find the average or mean slope of the function on this interval, i.e.
\[ \frac { f($d1) - f($c1) }{ $d1 - ($c1) } = \]

$BR
By the Mean Value Theorem, we know there exists a \( c \) in the open interval
\( ($c1, $d1) \) such that \( f'( c) \) is equal to this mean slope.  For this problem,
there is only one  \( c \) that works.  Find it.
