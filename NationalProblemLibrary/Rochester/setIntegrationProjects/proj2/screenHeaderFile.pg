BEGIN_TEXT
This problem set is Project 2.  Unlike Project 1 this project is done
entirely within WeBWorK. No hard copy has to be turned in.
The problems in this set are very much interrelated. It is strongly suggested that
you print out each problem after WeBWorK has confirmed your answers so that
you can refer to them while working on subsequent problems in the set.
