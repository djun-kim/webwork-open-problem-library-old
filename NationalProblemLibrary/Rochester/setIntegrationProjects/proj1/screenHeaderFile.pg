BEGIN_TEXT
This Webwork problem is Project 1 due: $formatedDueDate. You may still turn
in this project after the due date, but you will lose 1 point per week for
every week that passes after the due date.

$PAR
This project is intended to demonstrate the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for a fairly complicated function.
It is not a regular Webwork problem. Points earned on the project will count
as bonus points which will be added to your course total after the letter
grade distribution for the course has been determined.


$PAR
To get ANY credit on this problem, you need to turn in printouts of spreadsheets as explained
in the problem.  You will also need to turn in a printout of the confirmation from Webwork
that you have answered the problem correctly.  (You have to answer at least the F(x) questions
correctly to get any partial credit.)

$PAR
If you don't have spreadsheet software on
your home computer,  search for UTS computing sites which have the popular Microsoft
spreadsheet "Excel".  You can use
\{ htmlLink("http://www.osu.edu/units/uts/campus/sites/softsearch.html","the following link")\}
to do the search.
