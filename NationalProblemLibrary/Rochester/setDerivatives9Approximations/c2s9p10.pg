Let \( f(t) \) be the weight (in grams)
of a solid sitting in a beaker of water.  Suppose that the solid dissolves
in such a way that the rate of change (in grams/minute) of the weight of the
solid at any time \(t \) can be determined from the weight using the forumula:
 \[ f'(t) = !{$a} f(t) ( $b + f(t) ) \]

$PAR
If there is $c grams of solid at time \(t = 2 \) estimate the amount of solid 1 second later.
