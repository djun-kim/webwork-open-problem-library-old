SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));

$SOL $BR

Recall that the Manhattan distance between the points \( (x_1,y_1) \) and
\( (x_2, y_2) \) is defined as:

\[D_M = |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1-y_2| \]

We have been given the points \( ($x1 , $y1) \) and \( ($x2 , $y2 )\) $BR
Therefore, \[D_M = |$x1 - $x2| + |$y1 - $y2| \]
\[D_M = $dx + $dy \]
\[D_M = $distance\]
END_SOLUTION
