BEGIN_TEXT

To determine whether or not they have a certain desease, $n people are to have their blood tested. However, rather than testing each
individual separately, it has been decided first to group the people in groups of 10. The blood samples of the 10 people in each group will be
pooled and analized together. If the test is negative. one test will suffice for the 10 people (we are assuming that the pooled test will be
positive if and only if at least one person in the pool has the desease); whereas, if the test is positive each of the
10 people will also be individually tested and, in all, 11 tests will be made on this group. Assume the probability that a person has the
desease is $p for all people, independently of each other, and compute the expected number of tests necessary for each group. $BR

answer: \{ans_rule(40)\}
