BEGIN_TEXT
The graph of the function 
\( f(x)=$a + \log_$b x \)
can be obtained from the graph of
\( g(x)=\log_$b x \)
by one of the following actions:
$BR 
(a) shifting the graph of \(g(x)\) to the right $a units;
$BR
(b) shifting the graph of \(g(x)\) to the left $a units;
$BR 
(c) shifting the graph of \(g(x)\) upward $a units;
$BR 
(d) shifting the graph of \(g(x)\) downward $a units;
$BR 
Your answer is (input a, b, c, or d) \{ans_rule(15) \}
$BR
The domain of the function \(f(x)\) is \(x > A\), find \(A\)
$BR
The value of \(A\) is \{ans_rule(15) \}
$BR
Is the range  of the function \(f(x)\) still \( (-\infty,\infty) \)?
$BR
Your answer is (input Yes or No) \{ans_rule(15) \}
