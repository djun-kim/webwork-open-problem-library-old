 qq!The graph indicates the RATE of absorbtion of carbon dioxide into a body of water.
 The rate varies with time.  Positive quantities mean that the carbon dioxide is being
 abosrbed into solution, while negative quantities mean the carbon dioxide is being
 released to the air. $BR For each interval, enter all letters whose corresponding
 statements are true for that interval.)!
