TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
When air expands adiabatically (without gaining or losing heat), its
pressure \( P\) and volume \( V \) are related by the equation \(
PV^{1.4}=C \) where \( C \) is a constant.  Suppose that at a certain
instant the volume is \(!{$vol:%6.3g}\) cubic centimeters and the pressure is
\(!{$pressure:%6.3g}\) kPa and is decreasing at a rate of
\(!{$pressureRate:%6.3g}\) kPa/minute.  At what
rate in cubic centimeters per minute is the volume increasing at this instant?

Pascal -- it is equivalent to one Newton/(meter squared); kPa is a kiloPascal or
1000 Pascals.  )
