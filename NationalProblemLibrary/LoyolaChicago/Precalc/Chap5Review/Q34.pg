$BR $SPACE $BR 
$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR 
a) Each expression is explained below:
$BR $SPACE $BR
$SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE (i) \( f(k+10) \) is the cost of building \( k + 10 \) chairs.  Therefore this expression represents the cost if she increases the number of chairs she builds in one week by 10.
$BR
$SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE (ii) \( f(k)+10 \) is ${DOLLAR}10 more than the cost of building \( k \) chairs.  Therefore this expression represents an increase in weekly cost by ${DOLLAR}10.
$BR
$SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE (iii) \( f(2k) \) is the cost of building \( 2k \) chairs.  Therefore this expression represents the cost if she doubles the number of chairs she builds in one week.
$BR
$SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE (iv) \( 2f(k) \) is twice the cost of building \( k \) chairs in one week. 
$BR $SPACE $BR
b) If the carpenter builds \(k\) chairs in one week, the total 
cost is \( f(k) \). Now, $sell${PERCENT} of the cost is 
\( $dec_sell \cdot f(k) \), and therefore $sell${PERCENT} above cost 
is \( (1+$dec_sell) \cdot f(k)= $coef_sell \cdot f(k) \).  

Tax on this amount is
\( $dec_tax\cdot $coef_sell \cdot f(k) \).  So, adding in the sales
tax we get a gross income of
$BR $BR
Gross Income = \( $coef_sell \cdot f(k) + (1+$dec_tax)\cdot $coeff_sell
\cdot f(k) = $coef_sell\cdot $coef_tax \cdot f(k) \) .
