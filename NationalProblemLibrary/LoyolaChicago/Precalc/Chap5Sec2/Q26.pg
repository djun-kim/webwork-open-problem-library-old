Question 26:
$BR
$SPACE
$BR
If the graph of the line $BITALIC y = mx + b $EITALIC is relfected over the $BITALIC $axis[$i]${EITALIC}-axis, what will be the slope and intercepts of the new graph?  (Your answers will depend on the parameters $BITALIC b $EITALIC and $BITALIC m${EITALIC}). 
$BR
$SPACE
$BR
a) The slope will be \{ ans_rule(10) \}
$BR
b) The $BITALIC y${EITALIC}-intercept will be $BITALIC y $EITALIC = \{ ans_rule(10) \}
$BR
c) The $BITALIC x${EITALIC}-intercept will be $BITALIC x $EITALIC = \{ ans_rule(10) \}
