Question 16:
$BR $SPACE $BR
Every day I take the same taxi over the same route from home to the
train station. The trip is $BITALIC x $EITALIC miles, so the cost for the
trip is $BITALIC f(x)${EITALIC}. Match each story in (a)-(d) to a function in
(i)-(iv) representing the amount paid to the driver.
