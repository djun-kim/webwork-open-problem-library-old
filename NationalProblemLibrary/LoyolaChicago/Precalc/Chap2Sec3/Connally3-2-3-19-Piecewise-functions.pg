Many printing presses are designed with large plates
that print a fixed number of pages as a unit.  Each 
unit is called a signature.  A particular press 
prints signatures of $pagespersig pages each.  Suppose 
\( C(p) \) is the cost of printing a book of \( p \)
pages, assuming each signature printed costs
${DOLLAR}${costpersig}.
$BR
$BR
(a) What is the cost of printing a book of $pages pages?
${DOLLAR} \{ ans_rule(10) \}  
$BR
What if there are $pages1 pages?
${DOLLAR} \{ ans_rule(10) \} 
$BR
What if there are \( p \) pages?
\( C(p) = \) 
${DOLLAR} \{ ans_rule(10) \} 
where the cost is rounded (up/down)
\{ pop_up_list(["?","up","down"]) \} 
for the next signature.
$BR
$BR
(b) What are the domain and range of \( C(p) \)?
$BR
Domain: all nonnegative integer multiples of (1 through 16)
\{ pop_up_list(["?","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8",
"9","10","11","12","13","14","15","16"]) \}
$BR
Range: $SPACE all nonnegative integer multiples of 
(0.01 through 0.20)
\{ pop_up_list(["?","0.01","0.02","0.03","0.04","0.05",
"0.06","0.07","0.08","0.09","0.10","0.11","0.12","0.13",
"0.14","0.15","0.16","0.17","0.18","0.19","0.20"]) \}
$BR
$BR
(c) On a piece of paper, sketch a graph of \( C(p) \).
