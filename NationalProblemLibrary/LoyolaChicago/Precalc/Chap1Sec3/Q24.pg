Question 24:
$BR $SPACE $BR
A company finds that there is a linear relationship between the amount of money that it spends on advertising and the number of units it sells.  If it spends no money on advertising it sells $b units.  For each additional ${DOLLAR}$dx spent, an additional $dy units are sold. 
$BR $SPACE $BR
a) If $BITALIC x $EITALIC is the amount of money that the company spends on advertising, find a formula for $BITALIC y ${EITALIC}, the number of units sold as a function of $BITALIC x ${EITALIC}.  (do not use commas in your formula).
$BR
\( y = \ \) \{ ans_rule(25) \}
$BR $SPACE $BR
b) How many units does the firm sell if it spends ${DOLLAR}$x[0],000 on advertising? (do not include any commas in your answer)
$BR
\{ ans_rule(20) \} units
$BR $SPACE $BR
c) How many units does the firm sell if it spends ${DOLLAR}$x[1],000 on advertising? (do not include any commas in your answer)$BR
\{ ans_rule(20) \} units
$BR $SPACE $BR
d) How much advertising money must be spent to sell 700 units? (do not include any commas in your answer)
$BR
$DOLLAR \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$BR $SPACE $BR
e) \{ $checkbox_mc -> print_q \} $BR

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $SPACE $BR
$BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR
a)  The slope of this line is $dy/$dx = $m , and the $BITALIC y${EITALIC}-intercept is $b .  The equation is therefore $SPACE \( y = $m x + $b \) .
$BR $SPACE $BR
b) Substitute $BITALIC x $EITALIC = $x[0]000 into the equation in part (a), $SPACE \( ($m)($x[0]000) + $b = $y[0] \) .
$BR $SPACE $BR
c) Substitute $BITALIC x $EITALIC = $x[1]000 into the equation in part (a), $SPACE \( ($m)($x[1]000) + $b = $y[1] \) .
$BR$SPACE $BR
d) Set $BITALIC y $EITALIC = 700 in the equation from part (a) and solve for $BITALIC x${EITALIC}, 700 = $m${BITALIC}x${EITALIC} + $b .  $SPACE $SPACE Subtracting $b from both sides we obtain $show = $m${BITALIC}x${EITALIC} .  Finally divide both sides of the equation by $m to solve $BITALIC x $EITALIC = $spend .  The company needs to spend ${DOLLAR}$spend on advertising in order to sell 700 units.
