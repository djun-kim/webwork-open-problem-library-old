Question 20:
$BR $SPACE $BR
You bought a new car for ${DOLLAR}$b,500 in 2005, and the value of the car depreciates by ${DOLLAR}$m each year.  Find a formula for $BITALIC V ${EITALIC}, the value of the car, in terms of $BITALIC t ${EITALIC}, the number of years since 2005. 
$BR $SPACE $BR
\( V(t) = \ \) \{ ans_rule(25) \}
$BR
$BITALIC (Be sure NOT TO USE ANY COMMAS when you enter your formula.  For example enter two thousand as 2000 and not as 2,000.) $EITALIC

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $SPACE $BR
$BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR
They $BITALIC y${EITALIC}-intercept is $c since the initial value of the car when you purchased it (i.e. when $BITALIC t $EITALIC = 0) was $b,500.  The slope is -$m since the value goes down by ${DOLLAR}$m for every increase in $BITALIC t $EITALIC by 1.  Plugging these values into the general formula for a line $BITALIC y = mx + b $EITALIC yields the formula $BR \( V(t) = $c - $m t \) .
