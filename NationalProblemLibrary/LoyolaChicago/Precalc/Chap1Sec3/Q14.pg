SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $SPACE $BR
$BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR
a)  The slope of the function $BITALIC C(x) $EITALIC can be calculated by using the formula
\[  m = \frac{ y_1 - y_0 }{x_1 - x_0} \]
for any pair of points $SPACE \( (x_0 , y_0 ) \) $SPACE and $SPACE \( (x_1 , y_1 ) \) $SPACE in the table.  If we pick the pair of points ( $x[0], $c[0] ) and ( $x[1] , $c[1] ) ,
\[ m = \frac{ $c[1] - $c[0] }{ $x[1] - $x[0] } = $m \]
$BR $SPACE $BR
b)  From (a) we know the slope of the line is $m .  If we increase the input by 100 to go from $BITALIC x $EITALIC = 100 to $BITALIC x $EITALIC = 200, we must therefore increase the output by (100)($m) = $up_out.  The value at $BITALIC x $EITALIC = 200 is \( C(200) = C(100) + $up_out = $last \) .
$BR $SPACE $BR
c) The fixed costs are the costs when no cups are produced (when $BITALIC x $EITALIC = 0), or the vertical intercept.  The fixed costs for Company A are $BITALIC C(0) $EITALIC = $c[0] while the fixed costs for Company B are $BITALIC F(0) $EITALIC = $d[0] .  $correct1 pays higher fixed costs.
$BR $SPACE $BR
d) The larger the slope, the steeper the graph of the line will be.  The slope of Company A is $m while the slope of Company B is $n.  $correct2 will have a steeper graph.
