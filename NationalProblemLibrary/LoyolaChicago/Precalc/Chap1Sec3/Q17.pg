Question 17:
$BR $SPACE $BR
Fill in the missing values in the table below in order to correctly represent the relationship between the radius of a circle with the corresponding area and circumference of the circle.  Give EXACT values, so you will need to enter the number \( \pi \) by typing $BBOLD pi $EBOLD .  For example if you wish to enter \( 2 \pi - 3 \) you would type $BBOLD 2*pi - 3 $EBOLD in the blank.

Decide whether the radius and circumference of the circle are a linear functions of the radius.  If it is a linear function, enter the rate of change in the corresponding blank below.  If it is not a linear function, enter $BBOLD NONE $EBOLD in the blank below.  Answers must be EXACT values.

$BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR
The area of a circle with radius $BITALIC r $EITALIC is \( A= \pi r^2 \), $SPACE  and the circumference of a circle with radius $BITALIC r $EITALIC is \( C= 2 \pi r \).  The table is therefore completed as follows:
$BR 
\{ begintable(7) \}
\{ row( "Length of radius", @x ) \}
\{ row( "Area of circle", @a ) \}
\{ row( "Circumference of circle", @c ) \}
\{ endtable \}
$BR $SPACE $BR
Based on the table, the area of the circle is not a linear function of the radius since the average rate of change between any pair of endpoints is not constant.  For example the average rate of change over the interval $SPACE \(0 \leq r \leq 1\) $SPACE is $SPACE \( \pi \) $SPACE while the average rate of change over the interval $SPACE \(1\leq r \leq 2\) $SPACE is $SPACE \( 3 \pi \).
The circumference is a linear function of the radius since it has a constant rate of change of $SPACE \( 2 \pi \).  It should also be clear from the formulas for each the area and circumference that these answers are true.
