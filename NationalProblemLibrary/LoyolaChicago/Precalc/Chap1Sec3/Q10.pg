BEGIN_TEXT

A phone company charges according to the formula
\[ C(n) = $b + $m n \]
where \(n\) is the number of minutes, and \(C(n)\) is the monthly
phone charge in dollars.

$BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD
$PAR
The slope is $m and the \(y\)-intercept is $b.
$PAR
a) The \(y\)-intercept $b is the monthly cost when \(n = 0\).  It is therefore the cost if no minutes are used, which is the fixed monthly cost of phone service.

$PAR
b) The slope $m represents the rate of change of the cost with respect to a change in the number of minutes used.  This means for every additional minute you use, the cost increases by ${DOLLAR}$m .  The slope therefore represents the cost per minute.
