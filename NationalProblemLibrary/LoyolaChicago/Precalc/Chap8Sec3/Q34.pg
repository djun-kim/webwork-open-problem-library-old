Question 34:
$BR
$SPACE
$BR
An average of \( $ave,000 \) people visit Riverside 
Park each day in the summer. The park charges ${DOLLAR}\( $admis.00 \)  for
admission. Consultants predict that for each  ${DOLLAR}\( 1.00 \)
increase in the entrance price, the park would lose an average of \( $loss,500 \) customers per day.
$BR $SPACE $BR
a) $SPACE Express the daily revenue from ticket sales, \( R \) as a function of the number of ${DOLLAR}\( 1.00 \) price increases, \( x \).
$BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ R = f(x) = \) \{ ans_rule(30) \}
$BR $SPACE $BR
b) $SPACE What ticket price maximizes the revenue from ticket sales? $SPACE ${DOLLAR}\{ ans_rule(10) \} (round to nearest cent)

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $SPACE $BR 
$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR 
a) $SPACE We can find the revenue function as a product, \( \mbox{Revenue} = \mbox{(number of customers)}\cdot\mbox{(price per customer)} \).
$BR $SPACE $BR
At the current price, \( $ave,000 \) people attend every day. Since \( $loss,500 \) customers will be lost for each $DOLLAR \(1.00\) increase in price, the function \( n(x) \) giving the number of customers who will attend given \( x \) one-dollar price increases, is given by \( n(x)= $ave,000-$loss,500 x\).
$BR $SPACE $BR
The price function \( p(x) \) giving the price after \( x \) one-dollar price increases is given by \( p(x)=$admis+x \). The revenue function \( R=f(x) \) is given by
$BR $SPACE $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ R = n(x)p(x) \)
$BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ = ($ave,000- $loss,500 x)($admis + x) \)
$BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ = $a2 x^2 + $a1 x + $a0 \).
$BR $SPACE $BR
b) The graph \( R=f(x) \) is a downward-facing parabola with zeros at \(x= -$admis \) and \( x= $zero \), so the maximum revenue occurs at \( x = $max_x \) which is halfway between the zeros.  Thus, to maximize profits the ideal price is ${DOLLAR}\( $admis \) + \( ($max_x) \)${DOLLAR}\(1.00 =\) ${DOLLAR}\($price\).
