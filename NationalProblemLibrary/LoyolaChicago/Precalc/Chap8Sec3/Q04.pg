Question 4:
$BR
$SPACE
$BR
Let $SPACE \( f(x) = x^2 + $k \) $SPACE and $SPACE \( g(x) = x^2 + $m \) .  Find the following functions, and simplify each as much as possible in order to write your answers in the indicated form in each part.  $BBOLD Under any circumstances you should not leave any box blank. $EBOLD
$BR
$HR
$BR
a) \( f(x) + g(x) = \) \{ ans_rule(5) \} \( x^2 \) + \{ ans_rule(10) \}
$BR
Give your answer in the form \( Ax^2 + B \) where $BITALIC A $EITALIC and $BITALIC B $EITALIC are constants.  Thus in each blank above you simply need to enter a number (or zero if the term does not exist).  Be sure to account for subtraction by using negative coefficients.
$BR
$HR
$BR
b) \( f(x) - g(x) = \) \{ ans_rule(5) \} \( x^2 \) + \{ ans_rule(10) \}
$BR
Give your answer in the form \( Ax^2 + B \) where $BITALIC A $EITALIC and $BITALIC B $EITALIC are constants.  Thus in each blank above you simply need to enter a number (or zero if the term does not exist).  Be sure to account for subtraction by using negative coefficients.
$BR
$HR
$BR
c) \( f(x) g(x) = \) \{ ans_rule(5) \} \( x^4 \) + \{ ans_rule(5) \} \( x^2 \) + \{ ans_rule(10) \} 
$BR
Give your answer in the form \( Ax^4 + Bx^2 + C \) where $BITALIC A $EITALIC , $BITALIC B $EITALIC , and $BITALIC C $EITALIC are constants.  Thus in each blank above you simply need to enter a number (or zero if the term does not exist).  Be sure to account for subtraction by using negative coefficients.
$BR
$HR
$BR
d) \( \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \) \{ ans_rule(35) \}
$BR
Enter your answer in any form, and $BBOLD it should therefore be an expression which involves the variable x $EBOLD.  However, you do not necessarily need to simplify.

$BR 

a) $SPACE We have \( f(x) + g(x) = (x^2 + $k) + (x^2 + $m) =  2x^2+ $a_const \).
