BEGIN_TEXT

After a cup of hot chocolate is poured, the temperature cools off very rapidly at first, and then cools off more slowly, until the temperature of the hot chocolate eventually reaches room temperature.  Let $BITALIC F(t) $EITALIC denote the temperature of the hot chocolate $BITALIC t $EITALIC minutes after being poured.

$BR 
This function is decreasing.  As the coffee cools off, the temperature decreases at a slower rate.  Since the rate of change is less negative, the graph is concave up.
