$BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR
Lines D and E have the same $BITALIC y${EITALIC}-intercept, which is positive, and moreover must be 60 since they cross the $BITALIC y${EITALIC}-axis at the highest value of the five lines.  Lines D and E must be matched with \( y = 60-x \) and \( y = 60 - 2x \).  Since E is steeper, it must have the more negative slope.  \( y = 60-2x \) must have graph E and \( y = 60 -x \) must have graph D.
$BR $SPACE $BR
Lines A and B have the same $BITALIC y${EITALIC}-intercept, which is positive, and less than 60 since they cross the $BITALIC y${EITALIC}-axis when \( y > 0 \) but lower than lines D and E.  Lines A and B must be matched with \( y = 20+2x \) and \( y = 20+4x \).  Since A is steeper, it must have the greater slope.  \( y = 20+4x \) must have graph A and \( y = 20 +2x \) must have graph B.
$BR $SPACE $BR
Line C is the only line which has a negative $BITALIC y${EITALIC}-intercept.  Similarly, the equation \( y = 2x -30 \) is only which has a negative $BITALIC y${EITALIC}-intercept.  Thus \( y = 2x - 30 \) must have graph C.
