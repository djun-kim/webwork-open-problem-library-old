$BR $SPACE $BR
You want to choose one long distance telephone company from the following options:
$BR
$BR
Company A charges ${DOLLAR}$m dollars per minute (no fixed monthly charge).
$BR
Company B charges ${DOLLAR}$b per month plus ${DOLLAR}$n per minute.
$BR
Company C charges a fixed rate of ${DOLLAR}$c per month.
$BR
$BR
$BR
Let $BITALIC A(x) ${EITALIC}, $BITALIC B(x) ${EITALIC}, and $BITALIC C(x) ${EITALIC} denote the monthly charges of Company A, B, and C respectively for spending $BITALIC x $EITALIC minutes on long distance calls.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $SPACE $BR
$BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR
a) If you use no minutes (when $BITALIC x $EITALIC = 0), the cost $BITALIC y $EITALIC = 0.  So the $BITALIC y${EITALIC}-intercept $BITALIC b $EITALIC = 0.  Also, the slope is $BITALIC m $EITALIC = $m since every time $BITALIC x $EITALIC increases by 1, your monthly cost increases by ${DOLLAR}$m .  Thus the equation for company A is \( A(x) = $m x \).
$BR $SPACE $BR
b) The fixed monthly cost (if $BITALIC x $EITALIC = 0), is $BITALIC y $EITALIC = $b.  So the $BITALIC y${EITALIC}-intercept $BITALIC b $EITALIC = $b.  Also, the slope is $BITALIC m $EITALIC = $n since every time $BITALIC x $EITALIC increases by 1, your monthly cost increases by ${DOLLAR}$n .  Thus the equation for company B is \( B(x) = $n x + $b \).
$BR $SPACE $BR
c) The slope is $BITALIC m $EITALIC = 0 since the monthly cost is constant, $BITALIC y $EITALIC = $c .  The equation for company C is \( C(x) = $c \).
$BR $SPACE $BR
d)  If you use 125 minutes, then the monthly bill for Company A would be ($m)(125) = ${DOLLAR}$q[0], the monthly bill for Company B would be ($n)(125) + $b = ${DOLLAR}$q[1], and the monthly bill for Company C is always ${DOLLAR}$c.  Since Company $least[$mark] charges ${DOLLAR}$q[$mark], it would have the cheapest monthly bill.
$BR $SPACE $BR
e) The blue, horizontal line 3 is the graph of Company C since its graph has slope 0.  The green line 1 through the origin is the graph of Company A's cost since Company A has no fixed monthly charge.  The red line 2 is matched with Company B since company B has a positive slope and a positive $BITALIC y${EITALIC}-intercept.
