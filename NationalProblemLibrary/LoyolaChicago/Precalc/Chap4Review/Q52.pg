Question 52:
$BR $SPACE $BR
A rubber ball is dropped onto a hard surface from a height of $a_ft feet, and it bounces up and down.  At each bounce it rises to $left$PERCENT of the height from which it fell.
$BR $SPACE $BR
a) Find a formula for $BITALIC h(n)${EITALIC}, the height in INCHES reached by the ball on bounce $BITALIC n${EITALIC}.  $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ h(n) = \) \{ ans_rule(30) \}
$BR $SPACE $BR
b) How high will the ball bounce on the \( $n^{\mbox{th}} \) bounce? $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ h = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \} inches (round to the nearest inch)
$BR $SPACE $BR
c) How many bounces before the ball rises no higher than an inch? $SPACE \{ ans_rule(10) \} bounces

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $SPACE $BR 
$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR 
a) The initial height is $a_ft feet, and since there are 12 inches in 1 foot, when $BITALIC n $EITALIC = 0 we have \( a = h(0) = $a_ft \times 12 = $a \) inches.  Since after each bounce the ball rises to $left$PERCENT of its previous height, we know the decay factor is $BITALIC b $EITALIC = $b.  Therefore we have $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ h(n) = $a($b)^n \)
$BR $SPACE $BR
b) We want to find the height when $BITALIC n $EITALIC = $n, so we will evaluate
\( h($n) \):
$BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ h($n) = $a ($b)^{$n} \approx $ans2 \mbox{ \ inches}. \)
$BR $SPACE $BR
c) We are looking for the values of $BITALIC n $EITALIC for which \( h(n) \leq 1 \) inch, so we set $BITALIC h $EITALIC = 1 and solve for $BITALIC n${EITALIC}:
$BR $SPACE $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ h(n) = 1 \) $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ $a($b)^n = 1 \) $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ ($b)^n = \frac{1}{$a} \) $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ \log{($b^n)} = \log{ \left( 1/$a \right) } \) $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ n \ \log{($b)} = \log{($a^{-1})} \) $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ n = \frac{ - \log{($a)}}{\log{($b)}} \approx $sol \)
$BR $SPACE $BR
So after $lower3 bounces, the ball will rise just over 1 inch, and after $ans3 bounces it will rise to a height just under 1 inch.  Thus after $ans3 bounces the ball will rise less than 1 inch.
$BR
