BEGIN_TEXT
You start $b miles east of Pittsburgh and drive east at a constant speed
of $m miles per hour. (Assume that the road is straight and permits you to
do this.)  Find a formula for \(d\), your distance from Pittsburgh, as a
function of \(t\), the number of hours of travel.

$PAR
You initially (at time \(t = 0\)) start $b miles away from Pittsburgh, so the \( d\)-intercept is \( b = $b\).  As you drive, you head east.  Since you initially start east of Pittsburgh, your distance from Pittsburgh is increasing such that for every hour you drive, your distance \( d\) increases by $m miles.  The slope of this linear function is therefore \( m = $m\), and the equation is \( d = $m t + $b \).
$PAR
It is worth mentioning that if you start $b miles east of Pittsburgh and drive WEST at $m mph, then at first your distance from Pittsburgh would decrease since you are getting closer to Pittsburgh (\( m = -$m\)).  After you reached Pittsburgh and continued heading WEST at $m mph, the equation would change since the slope would be positive (\( m = -$m\)).  The problem becomes more complicated, and in fact you would need to set up a piecewise function (see chapter 2).
