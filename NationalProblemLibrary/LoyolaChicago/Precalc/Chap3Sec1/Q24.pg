BEGIN_TEXT
Every year a lake becomes more polluted, and $r$PERCENT fewer organisms can live in it.  If in 2010 there are $number[$i] million organisms, write an equation relating ${BITALIC}N,${EITALIC} the number of organisms (in millions), to time ${BITALIC}t,${EITALIC} in years since 2010.

(Be sure to enter your formula in terms of millions of organisms.  For example if there are 8 million organisms, then ${BITALIC}N$EITALIC = 8 (not 8,000,000).)

In year $BITALIC t $EITALIC =0, there are $number[$i] million organisms, which we take as our initial value.  Our growth/decay factor is $b, for a decay of $decimal${PERCENT} per year.  Thus: $BR
