Question 14:
$BR $SPACE $BR
What are the effective annual rates for an account paying an annual interest rate of $r$PERCENT which is compounded:
$BR
$SPACE
$BR
a) annually? \{ ans_rule(20) \} $PERCENT
$BR
b) quarterly? \{ ans_rule(20) \} $PERCENT
$BR
c) daily (assuming there are 365 days in the year)? \{ ans_rule(20) \} $PERCENT
$BR
d) continuously? \{ ans_rule(20) \} $PERCENT
$BR
$SPACE
$BR
$BBOLD ROUND ALL ANSWERS TO THE NEAREST 0.001${PERCENT}${EBOLD}.

$BR 
a) The effective annual rate for an account paying $r$PERCENT per year is $r${PERCENT}.
$BR $SPACE $BR
b) With quarterly compounding, there are four interest payments per year, each of which is $r/4 = $quot[1]$PERCENT.  This occurs four times in one year, giving an effective annual rate of $BR

\( ($fact[1])^4 \approx $b[1] \), $BR
which is $ans[1]${PERCENT}.
$BR $SPACE $BR
c) With daily compounding, there are 365 interest payments per year (assuming a non-leap year), each of which is $r/365 = $quot[2]$PERCENT.  This occurs 365 times in one year, giving an effective annual rate of $BR
