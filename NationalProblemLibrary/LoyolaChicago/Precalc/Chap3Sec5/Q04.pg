Question 4:
$BR $SPACE $BR
What is the balance after 1 year of an account containing ${DOLLAR}$P which earns a yearly nominal interest of $r$PERCENT that is compounded:
$BR
$SPACE
$BR
a) annually? $DOLLAR \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$BR
b) weekly (52 weeks per year)? $DOLLAR \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$BR
c) every minute (there are 525,600 minutes per year)? $DOLLAR \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$BR
d) continuously? $DOLLAR \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$BR

$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR 

a) If the interest is compounded annually, there will be \( $P \cdot $annual_b = $annual \) dollars after one year.
$BR $SPACE $BR
b) If the interest is compounded weekly, there will be $BR
\( $P \cdot \left( 1+ \frac{$dec}{52} \right)^{52} = $P \cdot $week_rd = $week \) dollars after one year.
$BR $SPACE $BR
c) If the interest is compounded every minute, there will be $BR
\( $P \cdot \left( 1+ \frac{$dec}{525,600 \cdot 100} \right)^{525,600} = $P \cdot $min_rd = $min \) dollars after one year.
$BR $SPACE $BR
d) If the interest is compounded continuously, after one year, there will be \( $P \cdot e^{$dec} = $contin \) dollars after one year.
