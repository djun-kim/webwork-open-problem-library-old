Question 24:
$BR $SPACE $BR
An investment grows by $r$PERCENT per year for $t years.  By what percent does it increase over the $t-year period? \{ ans_rule(10) \} $PERCENT (round to 0.01${PERCENT})

END_TEXT

$after1 = 100+$r;
$after2 = round(10000*$b**2)/100;

ANS( num_cmp( $ans,tol=>0.005 ) );

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $SPACE $BR 
$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR
If the investment is growing by $r$PERCENT per year, at the end of one year a ${DOLLAR}100 investment would be worth ${DOLLAR}$after1. At the end of two years, it will be worth \( ($after1)($b) = 100($b)^2 = $after2 \).  Similarly, after $t years the invest will be worth \( 100($b)^{$t} \), and it will have grown by a factor of \( ($b)^{$t} \approx $almost \).  Thus investment will have grown by $ans${PERCENT}.
