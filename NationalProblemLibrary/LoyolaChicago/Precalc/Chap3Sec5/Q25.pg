Question 25:
$BR $SPACE $BR
An investment grows by $r$PERCENT over a $t year period.  What is its effective annual percent growth rate? \{ ans_rule(10) \} $PERCENT (round to 0.01${PERCENT})

END_TEXT

ANS( num_cmp( $ans,tol=>0.005 ) );

$BR
If the annual growth factor is $BITALIC b $EITALIC, then we know that, at the end of $t years, the investment will have grown by a factor of \( b^{$t} \).  But
we are told that it has grown by $r$PERCENT from its original amount.  So $BR
$SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE 
\( b^{$t} = $b_st \) $BR
$SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE 
\( b = ($b_st)^{1/$t} \approx $almost \).
$BR
Thus we know that it is growing by about $ans${PERCENT} per year.
