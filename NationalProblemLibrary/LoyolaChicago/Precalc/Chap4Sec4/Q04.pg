Question 4 :
$BR $SPACE $BR
You wish to graph the following relationship on a standard piece of paper:
$BR $SPACE $BR
The number of tuberculosis bacteria in 20 different people, 
some never exposed to the disease, some slightly exposed, some 
with mild cases, and some dying of it.  
$BR $SPACE $BR
Should you use a logarithmic scale or a linear scale? \{ $popup->menu() \}
$BR
Be sure you can explain WHY you selected your scale.

ANS($popup->cmp() );

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $SPACE $BR 
$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR 
This should be graphed on a log scale.  Someone who has never 
been exposed presumably has zero bacteria.  Someone who has been 
slightly exposed has perhaps one thousand bacteria.  Someone 
with a mild case may have ten thousand bacteria, and someone
dying of tuberculosis may have hundreds of thousands or millions
of bacteria.  Using a linear scale, the data points of all the people 
not dying of the disease would be too close to be readable.
