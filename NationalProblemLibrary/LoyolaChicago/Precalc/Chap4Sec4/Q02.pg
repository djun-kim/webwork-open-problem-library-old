Question 2:
$BR $SPACE $BR
You wish to graph the following relationship on a standard piece of paper:
$BR $SPACE $BR
The number of diamonds owned by 20 people, one of whom is a
multi-billionaire. 
$BR $SPACE $BR
Should you use a logarithmic scale or a linear scale? \{ $popup->menu() \}
$BR
Be sure you can explain WHY you selected your scale.
END_TEXT

ANS($popup->cmp() );

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $SPACE $BR 
$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR 
In all cases, the average number of diamonds owned is
probably less than 100 (probably less than 20).  Therefore, the
data will fit neatly into a linear scale.
$BR
