BEGIN_TEXT

The gross domestic product (GDP) of the US is given by $BITALIC G(t) $EITALIC where $BITALIC t $EITALIC is the number of years since 1990, and the units of $BITALIC G $EITALIC are billions of dollars.

$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR 
1. \( G(11) \) is the output corresponding to the input of \( t=11 \). So \( G(11) \) represents the GDP for the year 2001 (11 years after 1990).
$BR $SPACE $BR 
2. The input to the \( G^{-1} \) function is billions of dollars, so its output is a time in years after 1990. Thus, \( G^{-1}(9873) \) represents the number of years after 1990 at which the GDP is 9873 billion dollars.
