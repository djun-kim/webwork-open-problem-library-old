Question 32:
$BR $SPACE $BR
An account pays interest at a nominal rate of $r$PERCENT per year.  Find the effective annual yield if interest is compounded:
$BR
$SPACE
$BR
a) monthly? \{ ans_rule(20) \} $PERCENT
$BR
b) weekly? \{ ans_rule(20) \} $PERCENT
$BR
c) daily (assuming there are 365 days in the year)? \{ ans_rule(20) \} $PERCENT
$BR
d) continuously? \{ ans_rule(20) \} $PERCENT

$BR 
a) With monthly compounding, there are twelve interest payments per year, each of which is $r/12 = $quot[0]$PERCENT.  This occurs twelve times in one year, giving an effective annual rate of $BR
