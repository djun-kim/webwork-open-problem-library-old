SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $SPACE $BR
$BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR
a) The input $a_in corresponds to the number of minutes past 5 PM, and the output $a_out indicates the number of people who are eating in the restaurant at this time.  Thus the mathematical expression $BITALIC f( $a_in ) $EITALIC = $a_out means there are $a_out people eating at 5:0${a_in} PM.
$BR $SPACE $BR
b)   The output $b_out indicates the number of people who are eating in the restaurant at a particular time (in minutes after 5 PM).  Thus the mathematical expression $BITALIC f(a) $EITALIC = $b_out means $BITALIC a $EITALIC minutes after 5 PM there are $b_out people eating.
$BR $SPACE $BR
c)  The input $b_out corresponds to the number of minutes past 5 PM.  Thus the mathematical expression $BITALIC f( $b_out ) = b $EITALIC means there are $BITALIC b $EITALIC people eating at 5:${b_out} PM.
$BR $SPACE $BR
d) The $BITALIC t $EITALIC corresponds to the time (in number of minutes past 5 PM), and the output $BITALIC n $EITALIC indicates the number of people who are eating in the restaurant at this time.  Thus the mathematical expression $BITALIC n = f(t) $EITALIC indicates there are $BITALIC n $EITALIC people eating in the restaurant $BITALIC t $EITALIC minutes past 5 PM.  None of these statements explain this correctly, so the answer is None of the above.
