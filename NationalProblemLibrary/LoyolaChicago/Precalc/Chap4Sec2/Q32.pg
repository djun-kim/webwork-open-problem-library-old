$BR 
a) Let \( P(t)=P_0b^t \) describe our population at the end of \( t \) years.  Since \( P_0 \) is the initial population, and the population doubles every
$d years, we know that, at the end of $d years, our population will be \( 2 P_0 \).  But at the end of $d years, our population is \( P($d)= P_0 b^{$d} \).  Thus
$BR $SPACE $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ P_0b^{$d} = 2 P_0 \) $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ b^{$d} =  2 \) $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ b = 2^{1/$d} \approx $b_yr \) $BR
$BR 
Since $BITALIC b $EITALIC is our growth factor, the population is, yearly, $pct_yr${PERCENT} of what it had been the previous year.  Thus it is growing by $r${PERCENT} per year.
$BR $SPACE $BR
b) Writing our formula as \( P(t)=P_0 e^{kt} \), we have \( P($d)=P_0e^{$d k} \).  But we already know that \( P($d) = 2P_0\).  Therefore, $BR $SPACE $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ P_0e^{$d k} = 2P_0 \) $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ e^{$d k} = 2 \) $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ \ln{ \left( e^{$d k} \right)} =  \ln{ 2} \) $BR
\( ($d k) \ln{e} = \ln{2} \) $BR
\( $d k = \ln{2} \) $BR
\( k = \frac{\ln{2}}{$d} \approx $k_rd \).
$BR
This tells us that we have a continuous annual growth rate of $cont$PERCENT per year.
