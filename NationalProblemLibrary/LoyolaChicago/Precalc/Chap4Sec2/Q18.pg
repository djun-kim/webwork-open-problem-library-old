BEGIN_TEXT

Write the exponential function \( y = $a e^{$k t} \)
in the form \( y = ab^t \).  
$BR
$BR
(a) Once you have rewritten the formula, give ${BITALIC}b${EITALIC} accurate to at least four decimal places.
$BR  
\( \ b = \) \{ ans_rule(15) \}
\{ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") \}
$BR
$BR
If ${BITALIC}t$EITALIC is measured in years, indicate whether the exponential function is growing or decaying and find the annual and continuous growth/decay rates.  The rates you determine should be positive in both cases of growth or decay (by choosing decay the negative rate is implied). 
$BR
$BR
(b) The annual \{ $popup->menu() \} rate is \{ ans_rule(15) \} $PERCENT per year (round to the nearest 0.01${PERCENT}). 
$BR
$BR
(c) The continuous \{ $popup->menu() \} rate is \{ ans_rule(15) \} $PERCENT per year (round to the nearest 0.01${PERCENT}).

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $SPACE $BR 
$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR
a) We want \( $a e^{$k t} = $a \left( e^{$k} \right)^t = ab^t\), so we choose \( a = $a \) and \( b = e^{$k} \approx $b \).  The given exponential function is equivalent to the exponential function \( y = $a ($b)^t \).  Since \( k = $k < 0 \) this formula represents exponential DECAY.  Likewise since the growth/decay factor \( 0 < b = $b < 1 \)  we have DECAY.
$BR $SPACE $BR
b) Since 1-$b = $dec_r, the annual decay rate is $r$PERCENT per year. $BR
c) Since $BITALIC k $EITALIC = $k the continuous decay rate is $cont$PERCENT per year.
