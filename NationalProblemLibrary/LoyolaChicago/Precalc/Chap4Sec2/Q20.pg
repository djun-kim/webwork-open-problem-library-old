BEGIN_TEXT

Write the exponential function \( y = $a ($b)^{t} \)
in the form \( y = ae^{kt} \).

(a) Once you have rewritten the formula, give ${BITALIC}k${EITALIC} accurate to at least four decimal places.

\{ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") \}
$BR
$BR
If ${BITALIC}t${EITALIC} is measured in years, indicate whether the exponential function is growing or decaying and find the annual and continuous growth/decay rates.  The rates you determine should be positive in the case of growth or decay (by choosing decay the negative rate is implied). 
$BR
$BR
(b) The annual \{ $popup->menu() \} rate is \{ ans_rule(15) \} $PERCENT per year (round to the nearest 0.01${PERCENT}). 
$BR
$BR
(c) The continuous \{ $popup->menu() \} rate is \{ ans_rule(15) \} $PERCENT per year (round to the nearest 0.01${PERCENT}).

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $SPACE $BR 
$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR
a) We want \( $a ($b)^{t} = ae^{kt} \), so we choose $BITALIC a $EITALIC = $a and we find $BITALIC k $EITALIC such that \( e^{k} = $b \).  Taking the natural log of both sides we find \( k = \ln{($b)} \approx $k \).  Therefore the given function is equivalent to: $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ y = $a e^{$k t} \)
$BR $SPACE $BR
Notice that because the growth factor $BITALIC b $EITALIC > 1 (or because k > 0) we have exponential growth. $BR
b) Since $b-1 = $dec_r, the annual growth rate is $r$PERCENT per year. $BR
c) Since $BITALIC k $EITALIC = $k the continuous growth rate is about $cont$PERCENT per year.
