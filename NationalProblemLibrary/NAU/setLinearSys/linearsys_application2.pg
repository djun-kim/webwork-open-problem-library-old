Country Day's scholarship fund receives a gift of $DOLLAR $total.  The money
is invested in CDs, bonds and stocks.  CDs pay $c $PERCENT interest, bonds 
pay $b $PERCENT interest, and stocks pay $s $PERCENT interest.  Country day 
invests $DOLLAR $diff more in bonds than in CDs.  If the annual income from the
investments is $DOLLAR $income , how much was invested in each vehicle?
