How to Install the WeBWorK Problem Library Version 2
--- -- ------- --- ------- ------- ------- ------- -

Installing the problem library can be done in 4 steps.

1. Download and unpack files

The files are located in the Rochester cvs (including this one).
Get the files and remember where you put them.  We will refer to
it below as that directory from step 1.

2. Tell WeBWorK where on your disk you put the problem library

In the file $WEBWORK_ROOT/conf/global.conf, set the following
values.  The first one is where you put the problem library files
in step 1.

$problemLibrary{root}        = "/opt/ProblemLibrary";
$problemLibrary{version} = "2";

The last line is the password you use for webworkWrite for mysql.

3. Run the installation script

Run the command NPL-update which is in the directory $WEBWORK_ROOT/bin.
If $WEBWORK_ROOT/bin is not in your path, you may need to specify
the full path, which might look something like

  /opt/webwork2/bin/NPL-update

The script will print diagnostic information as it goes.  When it
finishes, you are ready to go.

4. Adjust existing courses.

If you have courses which had been accessing version 1 of the problem
library, your courses will have a symbolic link in their templates
directories called Library.  Delete this link (rm Library).  WeBWorK
will make the correct new link for you the next time you need it.

5. Using the Rochester problem library from NPL

For many years, the canonical set of problems people would start with
for their WeBWorK installation was the Rochester collection.  All of
those problems are now part of the NPL.  Since development/refinement
of NPL problems will continue, it is a good idea to use the NPL
problems instead.

If you have existing problem sets, or you simply want to be able to
browse the Rochester problems as you always have, you can still use
the NPL problems for this purpose.

The trickiest part of the instructions for doing this is that
different systems may have put files in different places.  Here we
assume:

  NPL is located at /opt/ProblemLibrary

  Rochester problems were a symbolic link in each course templates
  directory called "rochester_problib" (you may have to substitute
  your own value in the commands below).

Then, move to the templates directory of a course:

  cd /opt/courses/MyCourseName/templates

Then execute the commands:

  rm rochester_problib
  ln -s Library/Rochester rochester_problib

Then repeat this for each existing course.  In the future, if new
courses are made by copying the templates directories from existing
courses, the changes will be carried over automatically.

Test and enjoy.

Upgrading
---------

First update the problems in the problem library.  "cd" to the
location of the problem library, which might be

  cd /opt/ProblemLibrary

depending on where you installed it initially.  From that location,
give the command

  cvs -q up -d

This will update any problems you have already, and download new
problems if the problem library has grown.
