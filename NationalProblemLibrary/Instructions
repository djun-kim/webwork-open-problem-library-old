How to Install the WeBWorK Problem Library Version 2
--- -- ------- --- ------- ------- ------- ------- -

Installing the problem library can be done in 4 steps.

1. Download and unpack files

The files are located in the Rochester cvs (including this one).
Get the files and remember where you put them.  We will refer to
it below as that directory from step 1.

2. Tell WeBWorK where on your disk you put the problem library

In the file $WEBWORK_ROOT/conf/global.conf, set the following
values.  The first one is where you put the problem library files
in step 1.

$problemLibrary{root}        = "/opt/ProblemLibrary";
$problemLibrary{version} = "2";

The last line is the password you use for webworkWrite for mysql.

3. Run the installation script

Run the command NPL-update which is in the directory $WEBWORK_ROOT/bin.
If $WEBWORK_ROOT/bin is not in your path, you may need to specify
the full path, which might look something like

  /opt/webwork2/bin/NPL-update

The script will print diagnostic information as it goes.  When it
finishes, you are ready to go.

4. Adjust existing courses.

If you have courses which had been accessing version 1 of the problem
library, your courses will have a symbolic link in their templates
directories called Library.  Delete this link (rm Library).  WeBWorK
will make the correct new link for you the next time you need it.

Test and enjoy.

Upgrading
---------

First update the problems in the problem library.  "cd" to the
location of the problem library, which might be

  cd /opt/ProblemLibrary

depending on where you installed it initially.  From that location,
give the command

  cvs up -d

This will update any problems you have already, and download new
problems if the problem library has grown.
