How to Install the WeBWorK Problem Library Version 2
--- -- ------- --- ------- ------- ------- ------- -

Installing the problem library can be done in 4 steps.

1. Download and unpack files

The files are located in the Rochester cvs (including this one).
Get the files and remember where you put them.  We will refer to
it below as that directory from step 1.

2. Tell WeBWorK where on your disk you put the problem library

In the file $WEBWORK_ROOT/conf/global.conf, set the following
values.  The first one is where you put the problem library files
in step 1.

$problemLibrary{root}        = "/opt/ProblemLibrary";
$problemLibrary{version} = "2";
$problemLibrary{userSQL}     = "webworkWrite";
$problemLibrary{passwordSQL} = "xxx";

The last line is the password you use for webworkWrite for mysql.

3. Set up database

In mysql, create a database called ProblemLibrary and give read access
to someone like webworkRead.  For example, you could use the following
(using your own value for rootPassword which is the password for root
to access mysql):

    mysql -u root -p=rootPassword

    mysql> CREATE DATABASE ProblemLibrary;

    mysql> GRANT SELECT on ProblemLibrary.* to webworkWrite@localhost;

4. Run the installation script

Make sure you are in the directory created in step 1.  The directory
should at a minimum contain the files loadDB2 and create_tables2.sql.
Then run

  ./loadDB2 rootPassword

Again, rootPassword is not the system root password, but the password
for user root in mysql.  If you don't supply it, you will be prompted for
it.

5. Adjust existing courses.

If you have courses which had been accessing version 1 of the problem
library, your courses will have a symbolic link in their templates
directories called Library.  Delete this link (rm Library).  WeBWorK
will make the correct new link for you the next time you need it.

Test and enjoy.

Upgrading
---------

If at some time in the future you get your hands on more problems,
upgrading is simpler.  Optionally remove the previous copy of the
library, unpack the new copy in the same place, and run loadDB.pl.
