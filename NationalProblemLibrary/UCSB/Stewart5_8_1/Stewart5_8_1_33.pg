$PAR
A hawk flying at 15 m/s at an altitude of 180 m accidentally drops its prey.  The parabolic trajectory of the falling prey is described by the equation
\[y=180-\frac{x^2}{45}\]
until it hits the ground, where \(y\) is its height above the ground and \(x\) is the horizontal distance traveled in meters after the hawk drops it.  Calculate the distance traveled (in meters) by the prey from the time it is dropped until the time it hits the ground.  Express your answer correct to the nearest tenth of a meter.

$PAR
Distance traveled = \{ans_rule(30)\} meters
