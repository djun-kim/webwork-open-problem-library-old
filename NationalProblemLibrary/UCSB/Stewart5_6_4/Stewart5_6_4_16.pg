$PAR
A bucket that weighs 4 lb and a rope of negligible weight are used to draw water from a well that is 80 ft deep.  The bucket starts with 40 lb of water and is pulled up at a rate of 2 ft/s, but water leaks out of a hole in the bucket at a rate of 0.2 lb/s.  Find the work done (in ft-lb) in pulling the bucket to the top of the well.

$PAR
Work done = \{ans_rule(30)\} ft-lb
