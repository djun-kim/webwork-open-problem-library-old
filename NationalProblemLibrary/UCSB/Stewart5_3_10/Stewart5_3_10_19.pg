Water is leaking out of an inverted conical tank at a rate of \(10,000\,cm^3/min\) at the same time that water is being pumped into the tank at a constant rate. The tank has height \(6\,m\) and the diameter at the top is \(4\,m\). If the water level is rising at a rate of \(20\,cm/min\) when the height of the water is \(2\,m\), find the rate at which water is being pumped into the tank.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(20)\} \(cm/min\)
