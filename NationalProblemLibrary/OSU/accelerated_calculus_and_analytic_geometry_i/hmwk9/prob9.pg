BEGIN_TEXT
As viewed from above, a swimming pool has the shape of the ellipse
\[\frac{x^2}{$a2}+\frac{y^2}{$b2}=1\]
The cross sections perpendicular to the ground and parallel to the \(y\)-axis
are squares. Find the total volume of the pool. (Assume the units of length and
area are feet and square feet respectively. Do not put units in your answer.)
$BR
\(V\) = \{ ans_rule()\}
$PAR

This is similar to problem 47 in section 8.1 of the text.
