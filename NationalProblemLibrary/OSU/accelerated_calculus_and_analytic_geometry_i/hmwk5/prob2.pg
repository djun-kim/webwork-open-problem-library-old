{\bf Note:} You can get full credit for this problem by just entering the
answer to the last question correctly. The initial questions are meant as
hints towards the final answer and also allow you the opportunity to get
partial credit.
$PAR
Consider the indefinite integral \(\int \cos^{$m}($a t)\sin($a t)\, dt\)
$BR
Then the most appropriate substitution to simplify this integral is
$BR
\(u\) =  \{ ans_rule()\}
Then \(dt = f(t)\,du\) where
$BR
\(f(t)\) =  \{ ans_rule()\}
$PAR
After making the substitution we obtain the integral \(\int g(u)\,du\) where
$BR
\(g(u)\) =  \{ ans_rule()\}
$PAR
This last integral is:
 =  \{ ans_rule()\} \(+ C\)
$BR
(Leave out constant of integration from your answer.)
$PAR
After substituting back for \(u\) we obtain the following final form of the answer:
$BR
 =  \{ ans_rule()\} \(+ C\)
$BR
(Leave out constant of integration from your answer.)
