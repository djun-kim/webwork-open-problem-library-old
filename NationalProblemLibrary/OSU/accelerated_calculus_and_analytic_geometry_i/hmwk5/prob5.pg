{\bf Note:} You can get full credit for this problem by just answering the
last question correctly. The initial questions are meant as hints towards the
final answer and also allow you the opportunity to get partial credit.
$PAR
Consider the definite integral \(\int_{\pi/6}^{\pi/2} \frac{\cos(z)}{\sin^{$m}(z)}\, dz\)
$PAR
Then the most appropriate substitution to simplify this integral is
$BR
\(u\) =  \{ ans_rule()\}
$PAR
Then \(dz = f(z)\,du\) where
$BR
\(f(z)\) =  \{ ans_rule()\}
$PAR
After making the substitution and simplifying we obtain the integral \(\int_a^b g(u)\,du\) where
$BR
\(g(u)\) =  \{ ans_rule()\}
$BR
\(a\) = \{ ans_rule()\}
$BR
\(b\) = \{ ans_rule()\}
$PAR
This definite integral has value
 =  \{ ans_rule()\}
