If ${BM}f${EM} is the focal length of a convex lens and an object is
placed at a distance ${BM}p${EM} from the lens, then its image
will be at a distance ${BM}q${EM} from the lens, where ${BM}f${EM}, ${BM}p${EM}, and ${BM}q${EM}
are related by the lens equation
\[ \frac{1}{f}  = \frac{1}{p}  + \frac{1}{q} \]
$PAR
What is the rate of change of ${BM}p${EM} with respect to ${BM}q${EM} if
${BM}q = $q ${EM} and ${BM}f = $f${EM}? (Make sure you have the correct sign for the rate. Note that \(f\) is constant.)
