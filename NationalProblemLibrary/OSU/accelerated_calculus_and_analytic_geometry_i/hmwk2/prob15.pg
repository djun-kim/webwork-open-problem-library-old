A street light is at the top of a \(!{$poleHeight:%5.3f}\) ft. tall pole.
A man \(!{$manHeight:%5.3f}\) ft tall walks away from the pole with a speed of
\(!{$speed:%5.3f}\) feet/sec along a straight path.  How fast is the tip of his
shadow moving when he is \(!{$distance:%5.3f}\) feet from the pole?
