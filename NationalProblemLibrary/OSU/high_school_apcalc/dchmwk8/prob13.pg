TEXT(beginproblem());
BEGIN_TEXT
This problem is the same as the preceding problem, except that
the locations of Centerville, Springfield and Shelbyville are
at \(($a,0)\), \((0,$b)\), \((0,- $b)\), respectively.
$PAR
Caution: Although this problem looks identical to the preceding one,
the answer is quite different. The following question is meant as a clue
as to why this is so.  Consider the point \((x,0)\) where the cable
branches into two parts one going to Springfield, the other to Shelbyville.
$BR
Then \{ans_rule(5)\}\(\le\ x \le \)\{ans_rule(5)\}
$BR
Is there a critical number IN THIS INTERVAL?
$PAR
We conclude that in this case the minimal length of cable required is \{ans_rule()\}
How do you justify this conclusion?
