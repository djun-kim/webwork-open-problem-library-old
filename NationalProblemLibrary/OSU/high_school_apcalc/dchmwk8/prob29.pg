$BR
A movie screen on a wall is $b feet high and $a feet above the floor.
At what distance \(x\) from the front of the room should you position
yourself so that the viewing angle \(\theta\) of the movie screen is as
large as possible? (See diagram.)

$PAR
To solve this problem, we use the law of cosines to express \(\cos(\theta)\)
in term of \(x\) as follows:
$BR
\(\cos(\theta) =\) \{ans_rule(50)\}
$BR
To maximize \(\theta\) we need to \{ans_rule(20)\} \(\cos(\theta)\). (Maximize
or minimize?)
$BR
We find that \(\cos(\theta)\) has a critical point at
$BR
\(x=\)\{ans_rule(45)\}
$BR
We conclude that the optimal distance for viewing is at
$BR
\(x=\)\{ans_rule(45)\}
