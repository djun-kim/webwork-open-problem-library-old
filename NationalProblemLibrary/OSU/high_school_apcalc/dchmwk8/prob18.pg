BEGIN_TEXT
A wire of length $a is cut into two pieces which are then bent into
the shape of a circle of radius \(r\) and a square of side \(s\).
Then the total area enclosed by the circle and square is the following
function of \(s\) and \(r\)
$BR
\{ans_rule()\}
$BR
If we solve for \(s\) in terms of \(r\), we can reexpress this
area as the following function of \(r\) alone:
$BR
\{ans_rule(35)\}
$BR
Thus we find that to obtain maximal area we should let
\(r=\)\{ans_rule()\}
$BR
To obtain minimal area we should let
\(r=\)\{ans_rule()\}
