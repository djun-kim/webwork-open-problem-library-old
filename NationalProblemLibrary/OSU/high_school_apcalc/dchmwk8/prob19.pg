BEGIN_TEXT
The two towns of Snarkton and Jumblerock agree to share the costs
of building a pumping station along the nearby Maloudor River to supply both
towns with water. Suppose that Snarkton is located at \((0,$a)\)
and Jumblerock at \(($b,$c)\) in the plane, and that the Maloudor
River flows along the \(x\)-axis. At which point \((x,0)\) should
the pumping station be located so as to minimize the total length
of pipeline required to connect the two towns to the pumping station?

$BR
To solve this problem, we need to minimize the following function of
\(x\):
$BR
\(f(x)=\)\{ans_rule(50)\}
$BR
over the closed interval \([a,b]\) where \(a=\)\{ans_rule(10)\}
and \(b=\)\{ans_rule(10)\}.
$BR
We find that \(f(x)\) has only one critical number in the interval
at \(x=\)\{ans_rule(35)\}
$BR
where \(f(x)\) has value \{ans_rule(45)\}
$BR
Since this is smaller than the values of \(f(x)\) at the two endpoints,
we conclude that this is the minimal sum of distances.
