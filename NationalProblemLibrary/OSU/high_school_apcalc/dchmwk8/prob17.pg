BEGIN_TEXT
The diagonals of a convex quadrilateral are mutually perpendicular.
The sum of the lengths of the diagonals is $a.  We want to find the
maximum possible area of such a quadrilateral.
$BR
Let us denote by \(x\) and \(y\) the lengths of the two diagonals.
Then the area of the quadrilateral is the following function of
\(x\) and \(y\):
$BR
\{ans_rule()\}
$BR
If we solve for \(y\) in terms of \(x\), we can reexpress this
area as the following function of \(x\) alone:
$BR
\{ans_rule()\}
$BR
Thus we find that the maximum area is
$BR
\{ans_rule()\}
