BEGIN_TEXT
Consider the function
\[f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2+$coeff1 x + $coeff2} - \frac{$dd}{x^2+$coeff1 x + $coeff3}\]
$BR
Then the range of \(f\) is an interval. The left-hand endpoint of this
interval is \{ans_rule(15)\} (Write INF for \(\infty\) and MINF for
\(-\infty\) if appropriate.)
$BR
Is the left-hand endpoint included in the range of \(f\)? Answer (Y/N):
\{ans_rule(5)\}
$BR
The right-hand endpoint of this
interval is \{ans_rule(15)\} (Write INF for \(\infty\) and MINF for
\(-\infty\) if appropriate.)
$BR
Is the right-hand endpoint included in the range of \(f\)? Answer (Y/N):
\{ans_rule(5)\}
