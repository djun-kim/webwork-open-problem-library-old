Use linear approximation, i.e. the tangent line,  to approximate
\(  \sqrt[3] { $b1 } \) as follows: $BR
The equation of the tangent line to \( f(x) \) at \( x = $a2 \)
can be written in the form \( y = \) \{ans_rule(30) \}
EOT

$ans = "$m1*x + $y1 - $m1*$a2";
&ANS(function_cmp($ans));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Using this, we find our approximation for \( \sqrt[3] {$b1} \) is
\{ans_rule(20) \}
EOT

$ans = $m1*$b1 + $y1 -$m1*$a2;
&ANS(std_num_cmp($ans, .00001));
