A lighthouse is situated on a small island $a feet from a straight shoreline.
If the beacon on the lighthouse makes $d revolutions per minute, how fast is
the light beam moving along the shoreline when it is pointing $b feet away
from the nearest point on the shoreline to the lighthouse?
$PAR

To solve this problem, we first need to express the distance \(x\) along the
shoreline between the light beam and the nearest point to the lighthouse, in
terms of the angle \(u\) shown in the above picture. We find that
\(x=\) \{ans_rule()\} (Your answer should be an expression in \(u\).)
$BR
We have that \(\frac{du}{dt} =\)\{ans_rule()\} radians per minute
$BR
and that \(\frac{dx}{dt} =\) \{ans_rule()\} feet per minute.
