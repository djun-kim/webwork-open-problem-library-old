##DESCRIPTION
##KEYWORDS('derivatives', 'velocity', 'distance')
##  Given position of a particle, find
##  1) velocity at time 0
##  2) times when the particle is at rest
##  3) position after a period of time after both rests
##  4) total distance traveled after the period of time given in 3)

A particle moves along a straight line and its position at time \(t\)
is given by \( s(t)= 2t^3 - $d1 t^2 + $e1 t \) where s is measured in feet and
t in seconds.
