$BR
A function \( f(x) \) is said to have a $BBOLD removable $EBOLD discontinuity at \( x=a \) if:
$BR
$BBOLD 1.$EBOLD  \( f \) is either not defined or not continuous at \( x=a \). $BR
$BBOLD 2.$EBOLD \( f(a) \) could either be defined or redefined so that the new function IS continuous at \(x=a\).
$HR
Let \( f(x) =
       \begin{cases}
           \frac{$b}{x}+\frac{-$b1 x+$ab}{x(x-$a)}, &\text{if}\ x\neq0,$a\\
           $c, &\text{if}\ x=0
       \end{cases}
\)
$BR
Show that \( f(x) \) has a removable discontinuity at \( x=0 \) and determine what value for \( f(0) \) would make \( f(x) \) continuous at \( x=0 \).
$BR
Must redefine \( f(0)= \)\{ans_rule(15)\}.
$BR
Hint: Try combining the fractions and simplifying.
$BR
The discontinuity at \( x=$a \) is actually NOT a removable discontinuity, just in case you were wondering.
