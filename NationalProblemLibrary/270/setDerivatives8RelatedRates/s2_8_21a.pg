TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Gravel is being dumped from a conveyor belt at a rate of
$a1 cubic feet per minute. It forms a pile in the shape of a right circular
cone whose base diameter and height are always the same.  How fast is the
height of the pile increasing when the pile is $h1 feet high?
$BR
Recall that the
volume of a right circular cone with height h and radius of the base r
is given by \[ V= \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2h \]
$BR

Note:  See number 21 on pg 258 for a picture of this.
