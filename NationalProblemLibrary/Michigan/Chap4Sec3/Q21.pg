BEGIN_TEXT

For some positive constant \( C \), a patient's temperature change, \( T \),
due to a dose, \( D \), of a drug is given by  
\( 
T = \left(\frac{C}{2} - \frac{D}{3}\right)D^2.
 \)

$PAR
What dosage maximizes the temperature change?$BR
\( D = \) \{ ans_rule(25) \}

$PAR
The sensitivity of the body to the drug is defined as
\( dT/dD \).  
What dosage maximizes sensitivity?$BR
\( D = \) \{ ans_rule(25) \}

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

We have 
\[ T(D) = \left(\frac{C}{2} - \frac{D}{3}\right)D^2 =
   \frac{CD^2}{2}-\frac{D^3}{3}, \]
and so
\[ \frac{dT}{dD} = CD-D^2 = D(C-D). \]

Since, by this formula, \(dT/dD\) is
zero when \(D=0\) or \(D=C\), negative when \(D>C\), and positive when
\(D<C\), we have (by the first derivative test) that the
temperature change is maximized when \(D=C\). 

$PAR

The sensitivity is \( dT/dD = CD-D^2 \); its derivative is
\(d^2T/dD^2 = C-2D\), which is zero if \( D= C/2 \),
negative if \(D> C/2\), and positive if \(D< C/2\).
Thus by the first derivative test the sensitivity is 
maximized at \( D=C/2 \).
