BEGIN_TEXT

A smokestack deposits soot on the ground with a concentration
inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the stack.
With two smokestacks \(d\) miles apart, the concentration of the
combined deposits on the line joining them, at a distance \( x \) from
one stack, is given by
\[  S = \frac{c}{x^2} + \frac{k}{(d-x)^2}  \]
where  \(c\)  and  \(k\)  are positive constants which depend on the 
quantity of smoke each stack is emitting.  If  \(k = $a c\), find
the point on the line joining the stacks where the concentration of
the deposit is a minimum.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

We want to find \(x\) such that
\[ S = \frac{c}{x^2} + \frac{k}{(d-x)^2} =
       \frac{c}{x^2} + \frac{$a c}{(d-x)^2} =
       c\left(\frac{1}{x^2}+\frac{$a}{(d-x)^2}\right) \]
is a minimum, which is the same thing as minimizing 
\[ f(x) = x^{-2} + $a (d-x)^{-2} \]
since \(c\) is nonnegative.
$PAR

We have 
\[ f'(x) = -2 x^{-3} - $twoa (d-x)^{-3}(-1) = 
   \frac{-2}{x^3} + \frac{$twoa}{(d-x)^{3}} = 
   \frac{-2 (d-x)^{3} + $twoa x^3}{x^3(d-x)^3}. \]
Thus we want to find \(x\) such that \(-2(d-x)^3 + $twoa x^3=0\), 
which implies \( $twoa x^3 = 2 (d-x)^3 \).  That's equivalent to 
\( $a x^3 = (d-x)^3 \), or 
\( \frac{d-x}{x} = $a^{1/3} \approx $acr\).
$PAR

Solving for \(x\), we have \(d-x = $acr x\), whence 
\(x = d/(1 + $acr)\).
$PAR

To verify that this minimizes \(f\), we take the second derivative:
\[ f''(x) = 6 x^{-4} + $sixa (d - x)^{-4} > 0 \]
for any \(0<x<d\), so by the second derivative
test the concentration is minimized 
\( d/(1 + $acr)\) miles from the smokestack.
