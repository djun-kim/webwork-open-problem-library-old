BEGIN_TEXT

The number, \( N \), of people who have heard a
rumor spread by 
mass media at time, \( t \), is given by
\[
N(t) = a ( 1 - e^{-kt} ).
 \]
There are $p0 people in the population who hear the
rumor eventually.  If $ip percent of them heard it on the first day, 
find  \(a\)  and  \(k\) , assuming  \(t\) is measured
in days.

\( a = \) \{ ans_rule(35) \} $BR
\( k = \) \{ ans_rule(35) \}

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

Since as \( t\to\infty \), \( N \to a \), we have 
\( a = $p0 \). Note that while \( N(t) \) will never actually reach
$p0, it will become arbitrarily close to $p0.  Since
\(N\) represents the number of people, it makes sense to round up long
before \(t \to \infty\).  When \(t = 1\), we have 
\( N = $i ($p0) = $p1 \) people,
so plugging into our formula gives 
\[ N(1) = $p1 = $p0 \left(1-e^{-k(1)}\right). \]
Solving for \(k\) gives
\( $i = 1 - e^{-k} \), 
so that 
\( k = -\ln(1 - $i) \approx $kapprox \).
