BEGIN_TEXT

Find the formula for 
a function of the form \( y=A \sin (Bx) +C \) with a maximum at 
\( ($xmax, $ymax) \),
a  minimum at \( ($xmin, $ymin) \), and no critical points between these two
points.

$PAR
\( y = \) \{ ans_rule(35) \}

ANS( fun_cmp( "$a*sin(pi*x/$b)+$c" ) );

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

Since the maximum is \(y=$ymax\) and the minimum is 
\(y=$ymin\), the amplitude
is \(A=($ymax - $ymin)/2=$a \). Between the maximum and the minimum, the
\(x\)-value changes by $xdiff. There is half a period between a
maximum and the next minimum, so the period is $twob. Thus
\(\frac {2\pi}B = $twob\), so \(B=\frac{\pi}{$b}\).
The mid-line is \(y = C = ($ymax + $ymin)/2 = $c\), so the
function is 
\[ y = $a \sin\left(\frac{\pi x}{$b}\right)+$c. \]
