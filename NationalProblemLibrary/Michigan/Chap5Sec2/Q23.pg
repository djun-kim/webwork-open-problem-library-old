${BBOLD}A.$EBOLD
Because the function is $inc everywhere there can't be more than one zero.
There does have to be one zero because \(f\) is also $con everywhere, and
therefore must bend away from its tangent at \(($x0,$neg$k)\) (shown as the
black line in the graph).  Because the tangent clearly intersects the
\(x\)-axis, \(f\) must also have a zero.  Therefore the graph must have
exactly one zero, and, because the tangent has a zero at \((1,0)\), the
zero must be in the interval \((1 < x < $x0)\).

$PAR
${BBOLD}B.$EBOLD
We know that the slope of the function is $slpchg because \(f\) is $con,
and we know that the slope at \(x = $x0\) is \(f'($x0) =
$neg\frac1{$n}\).  The slope at \(x = 1 < $x0\) must therefore be $ls than
this, and so possible values of the slope are $fplist.
