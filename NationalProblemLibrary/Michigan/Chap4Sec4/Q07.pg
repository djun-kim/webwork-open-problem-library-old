BEGIN_TEXT


When production is $q0, marginal revenue is $mr dollars per unit
and marginal cost is $mc dollars  per unit. Do you expect maximum
profit to occur at a production level above or below $q0?
\{ ans_rule(35) \}
(Enter ${BBOLD}above$EBOLD or ${BBOLD}below$EBOLD.)

$PAR
If production is increased by $dq units, what would you estimate
the change in profit would be?
$BR
\( d\pi \approx \) \{ ans_rule(35) \} dollars

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

Since marginal revenue is larger than marginal cost around \(q=$q0\)
as you produce more of the product your revenue increases faster than
your costs, so profit goes up, and maximal profit will occur at a
production level above $q0.
$PAR
Then, because we know that \(\pi(q) = R(q) - C(q)\), the
derivative 
\(\pi'(q) = R'(q)-C'(q) \approx \hbox{marginal revenue}-\hbox{marginal cost}\)
so \(\pi'(q) \approx $mr - $mc = $mrmmc\).  Thus if the
production increases by $dq units, we can estimate the change in
profit as \( ($mrmmc)($dq) = $dpi \).
