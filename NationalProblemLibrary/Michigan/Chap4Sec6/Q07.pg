For positive constants \( k \) and \( g \), the velocity, \( v \), of
a particle of mass  \( m \) at time \( t \) is given by
\[
v=\frac{mg}{k}\left(1-e^{-kt/m}\right). 
\]
At what rate is the velocity is changing at time 0? At \( t=$t1 \)? What
do your answers tell you about the motion?

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

The rate of change of velocity is given by
\[
\frac{dv}{dt} = -\frac{mg}{k}\left(-\frac{k}{m}e^{-kt/m}\right) = ge^{-kt/m}.
\]
When \(t=0\),
\[
\left.\frac{dv}{dt}\right|_{t=0} = g.
\]
When \(t=$t1\),
\[
\left.\frac{dv}{dt}\right|_{t=$t1} = ge^{-$t1 k/m}.
\]
These answers give the acceleration at \(t=0\) and \(t=$t1\). The
acceleration at \(t=0\) is \(g\), the acceleration due
to gravity, and at \(t=$t1\), the acceleration is \(ge^{-$t1 k/m}\), a
smaller value.
