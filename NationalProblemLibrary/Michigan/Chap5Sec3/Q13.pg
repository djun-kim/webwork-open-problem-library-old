BEGIN_TEXT

Oil leaks out of a tanker at a rate of \( r=f(t) \) liters per minute,
where \( t \) is in minutes.  If \( f(t) = A e^{-k t}\), write a definite
integral expressing the total quantity of oil which leaks out of the
tanker in the first hour.

$PAR
total quantity = 
\( \int_{a}^{b} \) \{ ans_rule(35) \}$BR
(where \(a = \) \{ ans_rule(3) \} and \(b = \) \{ ans_rule(3) \}).

$PAR
What are the units of this integral?
\{ ans_rule(15) \}

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

For any \(t\), consider the interval \([t, t+\Delta t]\).  During 
this interval, oil is leaking out at an approximately constant rate of
\(f(t) = A e^{-kt}\) liters/minute.  Thus, the amount of oil which
has leaked out during this interval can be expressed as
\[
\mbox{amount} = \mbox{rate}\times\mbox{time} = f(t) \Delta t
  = A e^{-kt} \Delta t.
\]
and the units of \(f(t)\,\Delta t\) are (liters/minute)\(\times\)minutes
\(=\) liters.  The total amount of oil leaked is obtained by adding all
these amounts between \(t=0\) and \(t=60\).  (An hour is 60 minutes.)
The sum of all these infinitesimal amounts is the integral
\[
\mbox{total amount} = \int_0^{60} A e^{-kt} dt.
\]
