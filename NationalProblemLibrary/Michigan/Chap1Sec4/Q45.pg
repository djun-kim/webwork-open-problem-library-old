The half-life of radioactive strontium-90 is approximately $hl years.
In $y0, radioactive strontium-90 was released into the atmosphere
during testing of nuclear weapons, and was absorbed into people's
bones.  How many years does it take until only $left percent of the
original amount absorbed remains?

time = \{ ans_rule(35) \} years

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

Let the amount of strontium-90 in the bones be \(P = P_0 e^{-k t}\).
Since the amount of strontium-90 remaining halves every $hl years, we
can solve for the decay constant \(k\):
\[ 0.5 P_0 = P_0 e^{-$hl k},\quad\mbox{so}\quad
   k = \frac{\ln(1/2)}{-$hl}. \]

Knowing this, we can look for the time \(t\) in which 
\(P = $fr P_0\), or
\[
  $fr P_0 = P_0 e^{\ln(0.5)t/$hl},
\]
getting
\( t = \frac{$hl\ln($fr)}{\ln(0.5)} \approx $yr\) years.
