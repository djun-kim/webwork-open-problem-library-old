BEGIN_TEXT
In the year 2005, a picture supposedly painted by a famous artist
some time after $ans1 but before $ans2 contains $b percent of its
carbon-14 (half-life 5730 years).
$PAR
From this information, could this picture have been painted by this artist?
\{ $ans->menu() \}
$PAR
Approximately how old is the painting?
\{ ans_rule(35) \} years

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
We assume exponential decay and solve for \(k\) using the half life:

$BR
\(e^{-k(5730)}=.5\) so \(k=1.209681\times 10^{-4}\).

Now find \(t\), the age of the painting:
$BR
\(e^{-1.209681\times 10^{-4} t}=$l\) so
\(t=\frac{\ln($l)}{-1.209681\times 10^{-4}} \approx $dr\)
years.
$BR
This means it was painted in the year $c, approximately, and so $exp
