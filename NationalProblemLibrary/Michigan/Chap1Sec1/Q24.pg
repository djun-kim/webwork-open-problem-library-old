Write an equation that represents the following function.
The strength, \(S\), of a beam is proportional to the square of its
thickness, \(h\).
$BR
${BITALIC}Use the letter ${BBOLD}k$EBOLD for any constant of
proportionality in your answer.$EITALIC

$PAR
${BITALIC}S$EITALIC( \{ ans_rule(3) \}) =

We know that \(S\) is proportional to \(h^2\),  so
\[
S(h) = {k h^2},
\]
for some constant \(k\).

Write an equation that represents the following function.
The energy, \(E\), expended by a swimming dolphin is proportional to
the cube of the speed, \(v\), of the dolphin.
$BR
${BITALIC}Use the letter ${BBOLD}k$EBOLD for any constant of
proportionality in your answer.$EITALIC

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

We know that \(E\) is proportional to \(v^3\),  so
\[
E(v) = {k v^3},

for some constant \(k\).

BEGIN_TEXT

Write an equation that represents the following function.
The number of animal species, \( N \), of a certain body length, 
\( l \), is inversely proportional to the square of \( l \).
$BR
${BITALIC}Use the letter ${BBOLD}k$EBOLD for any constant of
proportionality in your answer.$EITALIC

We know that \(N\) is proportional to \(1/l^2\),  so
\[
N(l) = {k \over {l^2}},
\]
for some constant \(k\).
