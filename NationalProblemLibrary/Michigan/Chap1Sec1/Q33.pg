BEGIN_TEXT

For tax purposes, you may have to report the value of your assets,
such as cars or refrigerators.  The value you report drops with time.
``Straight-line depreciation'' assumes that the value is a linear
function of time. If a $v0 dollar refrigerator depreciates completely in
$t1 years, find a formula for its value as a function of time, 
\(x\), in years.

$PAR
value = \{ ans_rule(35) \} dollars

ANS( fun_cmp( "$v0 - ($v0/$t1)*x", 'var'=>['x'] ) );

$m = $v0/$t1;

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

We are looking for a linear function \(y=f(x)\) that, given a time \(x\)
in years, gives a value \(y\) in dollars for the value of the
refrigerator.  We know that when \(x=0\), that is, when the refrigerator
is new, \(y=$v0\), and when \(x=$t1\), the refrigerator is worthless, so
\(y=0\).  Thus \((0, $v0)\) and \(($t1, 0)\) are on the line that we are looking
for.  The slope is then given by
\[
m=\frac{$v0}{-$t1}=-$m
\]
It is negative, indicating that the value decreases as time passes.
Having found the slope, we can take the point \(($t1, 0)\) and use the
point-slope formula:
\[
y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)
\]
So, 
\[
y - 0 = -$m(x - $t1),
\]
and the equation for the value is \( y = $v0 - $m x\).
