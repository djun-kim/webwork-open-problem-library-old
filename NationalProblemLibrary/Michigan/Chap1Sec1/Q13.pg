BEGIN_TEXT

Find the equations of the lines that pass through the point 
\( ($a,$b ) \) and are parallel to and perpendicular to the line with
equation \( y +$c x=$d \). 
$BR 
Parallel: \( y= \) \{ans_rule( 60) \}
$BR 
Perpendicular: \( y= \) \{ans_rule( 60) \}

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
The line \( y +$c x=$d \) has slope \( -$c \). Therefore, the parallel 
line has slope  \( -$c \) and equation \( y-$b=-$c (x- $a) \) or 
\( y=$ans1 \) . The perpendicular line has slope \( 1/$c \) and 
equation \( y-$b=(1/$c) (x- $a) \) or \( y=(1/$c) (x- $a) +$b \).
