BEGIN_TEXT

Determine the slope and the \(y\)-intercept of the line whose equation
is given below: 

$PAR \($a x=$b y+$c\).

$BR Slope= \{ans_rule( 60) \}
$BR \(y\)-intercept= \{ans_rule( 60) \}

END_TEXT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Rewriting the equation of the line as 

\[ y=\frac{$a}{$b} x-\frac{$c}{$b} = $m x - \frac{$c}{$b} \]

we see that the line has slope \($m\) and vertical intercept 
\(-\frac{$c}{$b}\).

END_SOLUTION
