BEGIN_TEXT

An object is dropped from a $h foot tower.  (The acceleration
due to gravity is 32 ft/s\({}^2\).)
$PAR
When does it hit the ground?
$BR
After \{ ans_rule(25) \} seconds.

$PAR
How fast is it going on impact?
$BR
Speed = \{ ans_rule(35) \} feet/second.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

The velocity as a function of time is given by: \(v=v_0+at\).
Since the object starts from rest, \(v_0=0\), and the velocity is just the
acceleration times time: \(v=-32t\).  Integrating this, we get position
as a function of time: \(y=-16t^2+y_0\), where the last term, \(y_0\), is the
initial position at the top of the tower, so \(y_0 = $h\).
Thus we have a function giving position as a function of time:
\(y=-16t^2+$h\)
$PAR
To find at what time the object hits the ground, we find \(t\) when
\(y=0\).  We solve \(0=-16t^2+$h\) for \(t\), getting
\(t = t_1 = \sqrt{$h/16}\).
At this time it is moving with a velocity
\(v = -32(t_1) = -32 \sqrt{$h/16}\) feet/second.  The speed is the
postive value \(32 \sqrt{$h/16}\) feet/second.
