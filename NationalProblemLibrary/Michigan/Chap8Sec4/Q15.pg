BEGIN_TEXT

Water leaks out of a tank through a square hole with
$w-inch sides. At time \( t \) (in seconds) the velocity of
water flowing through the hole is
\( v \) ft/sec (where \(v\) is a function of time, \(t\)). Write
a definite integral that represents the total amount of water
(in cubic feet) lost in the first minute.
$PAR
Total loss \(= \int_a^b\,\) \{ ans_rule(35) \}
$BR
where \(a = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}
$BR
and \(b = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

We slice time into small intervals.
Since \(t\) is given in seconds, we convert the minute to 60
seconds.  We consider water loss over the time interval
\(0\leq t\leq60\).  We also need to convert
inches into feet since the
velocity is given in ft/sec.
Since 1 inch = \(1/12\) foot,
the square hole has area
\($wsq/144\) square feet.
$PAR
For water flowing through a hole with constant velocity
\(v\), the amount of water which has passed through in some time,
\(\Delta t\), can be pictured as a rectangular solid
with height \(v\,\Delta t\) inches and a square cross section with
sides \($w/12\) inches.
$PAR
Thus we can sum the volume of the water lost by adding up these
small time intervals:
\[
V = \sum\,($w/12)^2\,v\,\Delta t.
\]
Then as \(\Delta t \to 0\), the sum tends to the definite integral:
\[
\mbox{Total water lost} =
\int_0^{60}\, {$wsq\over 144}\, v\,dt \mbox{ ft}^3.
\]
