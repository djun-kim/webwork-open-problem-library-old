The figure on page 1179 of your text shows a pendulum with length
\(L\) (meters) and angle \(\theta\) (radians) from the vertical to the
pendulum.  It can be shown that \(\theta\) as a function of time
satisfies the differential equation:

\[
    \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + \frac{g}{L} \sin\theta = 0
\]

where \(g = 9.8\) m/sec/sec is the acceleration due to gravity.  For
small values of \(\theta\) we can use the approximation \(\sin(\theta)
\sim \theta\), and with that substitution, the differnential equation
becomes linear.  

$BBOLD A. $EBOLD Determine the equation of motion of a pendulum with
length $L meters and initial angle $theta0 radians and initial angular
