$BR 

A spring with an \(m\)-kg mass and a damping constant $c can be held
stretched $x0 meters beyond its natural length by a force of $F0
newtons.  If the spring is stretched \{2*$x0\} meters beyond its
natural length and then released with zero velocity, find the mass
that would produce critical damping.
