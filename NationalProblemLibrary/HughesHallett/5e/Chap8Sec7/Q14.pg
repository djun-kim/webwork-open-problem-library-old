Suppose that \( p(x) \) is the density function for heights of American
men, in inches, and suppose that \(p($c) = $p\).
Think carefully about what the meaning of this mathematical statement is.
$PAR
${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
Approximately what percent of American men are between $c0 and $c1
inches tall?
$BR
Approximately \{ ans_rule(5) \} percent.

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
Suppose that the average height of American men is 69 inches.
\{ $diff->print_q() \}
\{ $diff->print_a() \}

$PAR
${BBOLD}(c)$EBOLD
Suppose \( P(h) \) is the cumulative distribution function of \(p\).
If \(P(69) = 0.5\), estimate each of:
$BR
\( P($m1) \approx \) \{ ans_rule(15) \}
$BR
\( P($m2) \approx \) \{ ans_rule(15) \}

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
The area under the density function between \(x=a\) and \(x=b\) gives
the fraction of the population having a height between \(x=a\) and
\(x=b\).  Thus, if we assume that \(p\) is approximately constant
between \(x=$c0\) and \(x=$c1\), the area is
\(($p)($h) = $hp\), or about $p1 percent.

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
We expect the heights of American men to be evenly distributed around
the average value, so that \(p(x)\) is likely to have a maximum at the
maximum and to be smaller on either side.  Thus we expect that
\(p($c2) < p($c)\).

$PAR
${BBOLD}(c)$EBOLD
Finally, the CDF \(P(h)\) is the cumulative area under \(p(x)\).
Thus we can estimate values of \(P(h)\) near \(h = 69\) by assuming
that \(p(x)\) is approximately constant there and calculating the
area under \(p(x)\) between \(h=69\) and \(h=$m1\) or \(h=$m2\).
This gives
$BR
\[ P($m1) \approx 0.5 - $hp2 = $d2\]
and
\[ P($m2) \approx 0.5 - $hp = $d3. \]
