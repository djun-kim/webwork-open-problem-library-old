The figure below shows the distribution of elevation, in miles,
across the earth's surface.  Positive elevation denotes land
above sea level; negative elevation shows land below sea level
(i.e., the ocean floor).  The vertical axis of the graph gives
the fraction of the earth's surface per mile of elevation; the
horizontal axis gives the elevation (in miles).

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
Most of the earth's surface is below sea level.  Much of the earth's
surface is either around 3 miles
below sea level or exactly at sea
level. It appears that essentially all of the surface is between
4 miles below sea level and 2 miles above
sea level. Very little of the surface is
around 1 mile below sea level.

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
The fraction below sea level corresponds to the area under the curve
from -4 to 0 divided by the total area under the curve.  We can estimate
the total area with a left- or right-hand sum, getting about 13 boxes.
We can estimate the area with elevation below zero by similarly finding
a left- and right-hand sum.  With \(\Delta x = 1\) mile, we get
LHS(4)\(\approx 0.6\) and RHS(4)\(\approx 0.9\).  The average of these
is about 0.75.
