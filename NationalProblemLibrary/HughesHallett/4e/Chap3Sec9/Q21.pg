The acceleration due to gravity, \(g\), is given by
\[ g = \frac{G M}{r^2}, \]
where \(M\) is the mass of the Earth, \(r\) is the distance from
the center of the Earth, and \(G\) is the uniform gravitational
constant.
$PAR

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
Suppose that we change from our distance from the center of the
Earth by a distance \(\Delta r = x\).  Use a linear approximation
to find an approximation to the resulting change in \(g\), as a
fraction of the original acceleration:
$BR
\( \Delta g \approx \) \(g \times\) \{ ans_rule(35) \}
$BR
${BITALIC}(Your answer will be a function of \(x\) and \(r\).)$EITALIC

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
Is this change positive or negative?
$BR
\( \Delta g \) is \{ $posneg->menu() \}
$BR
${BITALIC}(Think about what this tells you about the acceleration
due to gravity.)$EITALIC

$PAR
${BBOLD}(c)$EBOLD
What is the percentage change in \(g\) when moving from sea level
to the top of \{ $mtHeights[$whichhMt]->[0] \} (a mountain over
14,000 feet tall in Colorado; in km, its height is
\{ $mtHeights[$whichMt]->[1] \} km; assume the radius of the Earth
is 6400 km)?
$BR
percent change = \{ ans_rule(35) \}

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
The linear approximation for \(g\) around a given distance
\(r\) is, with \(g = f(r) = \frac{GM}{r^2}\),
\(g \approx f(r) + f'(r)\Delta r\).  Thus the change in
\(g\) is just
\(\Delta g = f'(r)\,\Delta r = -\frac{2GM}{r^3}\,\Delta r\).
Writing \(\Delta r = x\), this is
\(\Delta g = -\frac{2GM}{r^3}\,x = -2\frac{GM}{r^2}\,(\frac{x}{r}) =
  -2g\,(\frac{x}{r})\).

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
This is clearly negative, which implies that the gravitational
acceleration is smaller the higher we go!

$PAR
${BBOLD}(c)$EBOLD
If we go from sea level to the top of $mt,
the change in \(r\) is \(x = $ht\) km,
so the percent change in \(g\) is
\( p = -2\frac{$ht}{6400}\cdot 100 \approx -$pchg\).
