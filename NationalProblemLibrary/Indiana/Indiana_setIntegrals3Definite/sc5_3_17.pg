This integration can be done because we know that the derivative with respect
to \(x\) of \(\cos(x)\) is \(-\sin(x)\).  So we obtain a \(-\sin(x)\) inside
the integral, and we can then integrate to obtain \(\cos(x)\).  Of course,
since there isn't a minus sign inside the integral, we'll have to multiply
inside and outside by \(-1\) (which doesn't change the value of course):
\[
\begin{align*}
\int_0^\pi \sin(x) dx
&=      -\int_{$b}^{$a} (-\sin(x)) dx   \\\\
&=      -\left( \left \cos(x) \right|_{$b}^{$a} \right) \\\\
&=      -( \cos($a) - \cos($b) ) = \cos($b) - \cos($a)	\\\\
&=	$soln_ans2 - $soln_ans1 = $answer
\end{align*}
