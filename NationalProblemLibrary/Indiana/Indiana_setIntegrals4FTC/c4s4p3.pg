&SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
One way to solve this problem is to compute the definite
integral and then take the derivative of the result.  This is
called the BITD (beat it to death) method.  Luckly, there is a 
shortcut in this case.  First, note that with \( y = x^{$b1} \)
we get the following:
\[
  f(y) = \int_{$c1}^y t^{$a1}\ dt
\]
Then, applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, remembering that
since we substituted \( y \) for \( x^{$b1} \) we will need to apply the
chain rule, we get:
\[
   f'(y) = (y^{$a1}) dy = (x^2)^{$a1} ( {$b1}x^{\{$b1-1\}} )
         = {$b1}x^{$e1}
\]
Then plugging $x1 into the formula, we get the answer to question
two as shown.
\[
  f'($x1) = {$b1}($x1)^{$e1} = $ans2
\]
