$SOL $BR $BR

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, part I, can be found on p.392 of your
textbook.  It says that if
\[ g(x) = \int_a^x f(t) dt \]
then the derivative of \(g(x)\) with respect to \(x\), written
\(\frac{d}{dx} g(x)\) or \(g'(x)\), is equal to \(f(x)\).  Call this
"Fact 1" so that we can refer to it below.  $PAR

Then on p.395, in example 3, we learn that we must use the chain rule if
the upper limit on the integral is not simply \(x\), but a function of \(x\):
\[ \frac{d}{dx} \int_0^u f(t) dt
	= \frac{d}{du} \left( \int_0^u f(t) dt \right) \frac{du}{dx}
	= f(u) \frac{du}{dx} \]
Call this "Fact 2" so that we can refer to it below.  $PAR

Applying that in this particular circumstance, we find
\[
\begin{align*}
f'(x)	&= \frac{d}{dx} \left( \int_{-$soln_a}^{\sin(x)}
		\left(\cos(t^{$soln_b})+t\right) dt \right)	\\\\
	&= (\cos(\sin^{$soln_b}(x))+\sin(x))\cos(x)
\end{align*}
\]
