When we graph this function, we see it comes out as 2 line segments, one
heading downwards from the y-intercept \(\left(0,$b\right)\) to the x-intercept
\(\left($soln_x_icpt,0\right)\), and another heading from the x-intercept
upwards and to the right, to the point \(\left($e,$soln_rep\right)\).
The whole function looks like this:  $BR
<center>
$graphtext  $BR
(click image to see large version in new window)
</center>  $BR

We shall consider each portion of the graph separately.  First, the section
before the x-intercept: the interval \(\left[0,$soln_x_icpt\right]\).  Looking
more carefully at just this portion of the graph, we see the following:  $BR
<center>
$lgrtext  $BR
(click image to see large version in new window)
</center>  $BR

This forms a triangle with base the line segment from \(\left(0,0\right)\) to
\(\left($soln_x_icpt,0\right)\) and height the line segment from
\(\left(0,0\right)\) to \(\left(0,$b\right)\).  The length of the base is
clearly \($soln_x_icpt\) and the length of the height is clearly \($b\).
So the area under this portion of the function is the area of this triangle,
specifically
\(A=\frac{1}{2}\cdot b\cdot h=\frac{1}{2}\cdot$soln_x_icpt\cdot$b=$soln_tri1\).
$BR

Next we examine the rest of the graph, from the x-intercept rightwards:
the interval \(\left[$soln_x_icpt,$e\right]\).  Looking more carefully at
just this portion of the graph, we see the following:  $BR
<center>
$rgrtext  $BR
(click image to see large version in new window)
</center>  $BR

This, too, forms a triangle, with base the line segment from
\(\left($soln_x_icpt,0\right)\) to \(\left($e,0\right)\) and height the line
segment form \(\left($e,0\right)\) to \(\left($e,$soln_rep\right)\).  The
base therefore has length \($soln_base\) and the height has length
\($soln_rep\), giving this triangle area
\(A=\frac{1}{2}\cdot b\cdot h=\frac{1}{2}\cdot$soln_base\cdot$soln_rep=$soln_tri2\).
$BR

So putting the areas of these two triangles together, we get the area under
the whole function: \($soln_tri1 + $soln_tri2 = $soln_final\).

EOT
} elsif ($e==$soln_x_icpt) {
&SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));

$SOL $BR

When we graph this function, we see it comes out as a single line segment
heading downwards from its y-intercept \(\left(0,$b\right)\) to its x-intercept
\(\left($soln_x_icpt,0\right)\).  This can be seen in the following graph:
<center>
$graphtext  $BR
(click image to see large version in new window)
</center>  $BR
Thus the area under it is the area of the triangle formed by the line and the
two axes.  The base of this triangle is from \(\left(0,0\right)\) to
\(\left($e,0\right)\) and the height is from \(\left(0,0\right)\) to
\(\left(0,$b\right)\).  Thus the base is of length \($e\) and the height is of
length \($b\).  Using the area of a triangle formula, we get:
\(A=\frac{1}{2}\cdot b\cdot h=\frac{1}{2}\cdot$e\cdot$b=$soln_final\).

EOT
} else {
&SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));

$SOL $BR

When we graph this function, we see it comes out as a single line segment
heading downwards from its y-intercept \(\left(0,$b\right)\) to the right
endpoint \(\left($e,$soln_rep\right)\).  It looks like this:
<center>
$graphtext  $BR
(click image to see large version in new window)
</center>  $BR

The region under this function is a trapezoid, with base \(b_1\) being the
line segment from \(\left(0,0\right)\) to \(\left(0,$b\right)\), base \(b_2\)
the line segment from \(\left($e,0\right)\) to \(\left($e,$soln_rep\right)\),
and height the line segment from \(\left(0,0\right)\) to \(\left($e,0\right)\).
Clearly then the lengths are as follows: \(b_1=$b\), \(b_2=$soln_rep\), and
\(h=$e\).  So we use the area of a trapezoid formula to compute our answer:
\(A=\frac{b_1+b_2}{2}\cdot h=\frac{$b+$soln_rep}{2}\cdot$e=$soln_final\).
