BEGIN_TEXT
Work of \($A\) Joules is done in stretching a spring from its natural length to \( $b \) cm
beyond its natural length. What is the force (in Newtons) that holds the
spring stretched at the same distance (\($b\) cm)?

$answer = 200*$A/$b;
ANS(num_cmp($answer));

$soln_b100 = $b/100;
$soln_A_Joule = ($A == 1) ? "Joule" : "Joules";
$soln_A_is_are = ($A == 1) ? "is" : "are";
$soln_interm = $soln_b100 ** 2 / 2;
$soln_interm2 = $A / $soln_interm;

$SOL $BR $BR

Because Joules are Newton-meters, we must convert the value $b cm to meters.
So in all calculations below, it is important to use $soln_b100 as the
distance, because if we're relating it to Joules, it must be in meters.
$BR $BR

Because the force required to stretch a spring to a certain length increases
linearly with that length, we know the function that converts stretch length
to required force will be of the form \(F(l)=a \cdot l+b\),
for constants \(a\) and \(b\).
But since 0 Joules are required to not stretch the spring at all, the
\(b\) constant is 0.  Now in order to calculate the force required to
keep the srping stretched at $soln_b100 meters,
we merely need to plug $soln_b100 into the
function \(F(l)=a \cdot l\), except we don't know the value \(a\).
$BR $BR

However, we do know that the total force required to do the whole stretching
from 0 to $soln_b100 meters was $A $soln_A_Joule.
So we integrate \(F(l)\) from 0
to $soln_b100 meters to see how much force it would require,
and the answer we get
will be an expression in terms of \(a\).  We can then set this expression
equal to $A, and thus solve for \(a\):
\[
\begin{align*}
\int_0^{$soln_b100} F(x) \; dx
&=	\int_0^{$soln_b100} a \cdot x \; dx	\\\\
&=	\left \frac{a \cdot x^2}{2} \right|_0^{$soln_b100}	\\\\
&=	\frac{a \cdot $soln_b100^2}{2} - \frac{a \cdot 0^2}{2}	\\\\
&=	$soln_interm a
\end{align*}
\]
$BR $BR

So when we set \($soln_interm a = $A\) we discover \(a = $soln_interm2\),
and thus we can calculate
	\[
		F($soln_b100)	=	a \cdot $soln_b100
				=	$soln_interm2 \cdot $soln_b100
				=	$answer
	\]
