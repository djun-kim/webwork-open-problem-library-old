The force on a particle is described by \($a x^3 + $b \) at a point \(x\) along the \(x\)-axis.
Find the work done in moving the particle from the origin to \(x = $c\).

$SOL $BR $BR

Work is defined as force times distance.  But that's for when the force is
constant over the given distance.  When the force is changing,
as it is in this problem, we accumulate all the force over the given
distance not by multiplying, but by integrating:
\[
\begin{align*}
\int_0^{$c} \left( $a x^3 + $b \right) dx
&=	\left \left( \frac{$a x^4}{4} + $b x \right) \right|_0^{$c}	\\\\
&=	\frac{$a \cdot $c^4}{4} + $b \cdot $c
		- \frac{$a \cdot 0^4}{4} - $b \cdot 0	\\\\
&=	$soln_pt1 + $soln_pt2 = $answer
\end{align*}
