A cylinder is inscribed in a right circular cone of height $height
and radius (at the base) equal to $radius .  What are the dimensions of such a cylinder
which has maximum volume?
$PAR
Its radius is \{ans_rule(15) \} and its height is \{ans_rule(15) \}.

$r = 2*$radius/3;
$h = $height-$height*$r/$radius;

ANS(num_cmp($h));


SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$SOL $BR
As we are attempting to maxamize the volume of the inscribed cylinder,
we must first come up with a formula for the volume of this cylinder.
Let \( x \) be the radius of the cylinder, \( v(x) \) the volume.  We 
know from basic geometry that the formula for volume is give by 
\( \pi x^2h \) where \( x \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height
of the cylinder.  So in order to come up with a formula for volume
in terms of \( x \) only, we need to relate \( x \) to \( h \).
$PAR
This is where the information about the cone comes in handy.  The cone is 
a right circular cone.  Thus, inscribing the cylinder will fill up
some of the base of the cone, and just touch the slanted side, leaving
a similar right circular cone at the top.  This new cone will have a
radius of \( x \) and a height of \( $height - h \) where \( x \) and \( 
h \) are as in the formula for the volume of our cylinder.  As this cone is
similar to the origional, we can use ratios to get:
$PAR
\[
   \frac{x}{$radius}=\frac{$height - h}{$height}
\]
$PAR
Simplifying this, we get \( h = $height - \frac{$height}{$radius}x \).  
Therefore, our formula for volume in terms of \( x \) becomes \( v(x) = \pi 
x^2($height - \frac{$height}{$radius}x) = ($height\pi)x^2 - 
(\frac{$height}{$radius}\pi)x^3 \)
$PAR
Now, we want to maximize this.  So we will first take the derivative.  
Using the rules for differentiation of polynomials, the derivative is \( 
v'(x) = 2($height\pi)x - 3(\frac{$height}{$radius}\pi)x^2 \).  Solving
for zero, we get, as we don't want \( x = 0 \), the following.
$PAR
\[
    \begin{aligned}
      v'(x)  & = 0 \\
      2($height\pi)x - 3(\frac{$height}{$radius}\pi)x^2 & = 0 \\
      \pi x(2($height) - 3\frac{$height}{$radius}x) & = 0 \\
      2($height) - 3\frac{$height}{$radius}x & = 0 \\
      3\frac{$height}{$radius}x & = 2($height) \\
      x & = \frac{2}{3}($radius) = !{$r:%5.3f} \\
    \end{aligned}
\]

Then, using the formula for height we came up with before, the height
can be determined by:

\[
   h = $height - \frac{$height}{$radius}(!{$r:%5.3f}) = !{$h:%5.3f}
\]
