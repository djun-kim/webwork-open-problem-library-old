A fence $h feet tall runs parallel to a tall building at a distance of $w feet from
the building. We want to find the  the length of the shortest ladder that will reach 
from the ground over the fence to the wall of the building.
$PAR
Here are some hints for finding a solution: $BR
Use the angle that the ladder makes with the ground to define the
position of the ladder and draw a picture of the ladder leaning against 
the wall of the building and just touching the top of the fence.
$PAR
If the ladder makes an angle $theta radians with the ground, touches the top
of the fence and just reaches the wall, calculate the distance along
the ladder from the ground to the top of the fence.
$BR \{ans_rule(30)\} $BR
The distance along the ladder from the top of the fence to the wall is
$BR \{ans_rule(30)\} $BR

Using these hints write a function \(L(x)\) which gives the  total 
length of a ladder which touches the ground at an angle \( x \), touches 
the top of the fence and just reaches the wall.$BR
\(L(x)\) = \{ans_rule(30)\}.$BR

Use this function to find the length of the shortest ladder which will
clear the fence.$BR

The length of the shortest ladder is \{ans_rule(40) \} feet.
EOT

$theta2 =arctan( ( $h/$w ) **(1/3) );   # optimum angle
$ans = $w/cos($theta2) + $h/(sin( $theta2) );  # length of the ladder.
ANS(std_num_cmp($l1),std_num_cmp($l2)  );
ANS(function_cmp("$h/sin(x)+$w/cos(x)") );
&ANS(std_num_cmp($ans));


SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOF'));
$SOL $BR
As suggested by the hints, the simplest way to approach this problem 
is to use trigonometry.  Before we go through the solution to the main
problem, finding the length of the shortest ladder which will work in the
abovie situation, we will briefly mention the solutions to the two questions
posed in the hint.
$PAR
The ladder makes a right triangle as it leans against the fence and the
wall.  From basic trigonometry, we have the following relations where 
\( \theta \) is one of the two non-right angles of the triangle:
\[
  \begin{align*}
    \sin(\theta) &= \frac{\mbox{opposite}}{\mbox{hypotenuse}} \\ \\
    \cos(\theta) &= \frac{\mbox{adjacent}}{\mbox{hypotenuse}} \\ \\
    \tan(\theta) &= \frac{\mbox{opposite}}{\mbox{adjacent}} 
  \end{align*}
\]
As the height of the fence is the side of the right triangle formed by the
ladder, fence, and ground which is opposite the angle \( \theta=$theta \) given
above, if \( l \) is the length of the ladder, then \( \sin($theta) =
\frac{$h}{l} \) so \( l = \frac{$h}{\sin($theta)} = !{$l1:%5.4f} \).
$PAR
For the second part of the hint, we consider the triangle formed by the ladder
the ground, and the side of the building.  In this case, we still know the
angle, and we know the distance from the base of the building, to where the
ladder touches the ground.  This is the side adjacent to the angle, so we can
find the length of the ladder using \( \cos($theta) = \frac{$w}{l} \) so that
\( l = \frac{$w}{\cos($theta)} = !{$l2:%5.4f} \).
$PAR
Now, to solve the main problem, we need to write a formula \( L(x) \)
for the length of the ladder when \( x \) is the angle the ladder makes with
the ground as with \( \theta \) above.  As we saw above, the distance
from where the ladder touches the ground to the base of the building is
\( L(x)\cos(x) \) and the distance from the base of the building
up to where the ladder touches the side of the building is 
\( L(x)\sin(x) \).  Now, using the information from the problem, we
compare the two similar triangles formed by the ladder, ground, and
fence and by the ladder, ground, and building.  This gives the
ratio shown below.
$PAR
\[
  \frac{$h}{L(x)\sin(x)} = \frac{L(x)\cos(x) - $w}{L(x)\cos(x)}
\]
$PAR
Cross multiplying this equation and solving for \( L(x) \) gives us the function
we need.  Namely,
$PAR
\[
   L(x) = \frac{$h\cos(x)+$w\sin(x)}{\sin(x)\cos(x)}
\]
$PAR
Now, we find the critical points of this function by finding the derivative
and solving for zero.  Using the quotient rule to take the derivative, we
get the following:
$PAR
\[
   L'(x) = \frac{$w\sin^3(x) - $h\cos^3(x)}{\sin^2(x)\cos^2(x)}
\]
$PAR
Since we wish to know when this is zero, and that happens only
when the numerator of the fraction is zero, we need to solve the following
equation for \( x \) in radians.
$PAR
\[
  \begin{align*}
    r'(x) & = 0 \\
    $w\sin^3(x) - $h\cos^3(x) & = 0 \\
    $w\sin^3(x) & = $h\cos^3(x) \\
    \frac{$h}{$w} & = \frac{\sin^3(x)}{\cos^3(x)} \\
    \sqrt[3]{\frac{$h}{$w}} & = \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)} \\
    \tan(x) & = \sqrt[3]{\frac{$h}{$w}} \\
    x & = \tan^{-1}\left(\sqrt[3]{\frac{$h}{$w}}\right)
             \approx !{$theta2:%5.4f}  
  \end{align*}
\]
$PAR
It can be easily checked that this value of \( x \) gives a minimum 
length of the ladder.  To find out exactly what that length is, 
we plug the value back into our formula \( L(x) \) and simplify 
(remembering that this is all done in radians) as follows:
$PAR
\[
  L(!{$theta2:%5.4f}) = \frac{$h\cos(!{$theta2:%5.4f}) +
                         $w\sin(!{$theta2:%5.4f})}{
                         \sin(!{$theta2:%5.4f})\cos(!{$theta2:%5.4f})}
                     \approx !{$ans:%5.4f}
\]
