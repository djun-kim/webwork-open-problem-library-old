SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$SOL $BR
In order to solve this problem, we will need to write an expression
for the distance between this point and a point on our line.  Then, we
will need to find the point on the line which minimizes this distance.
$PAR
Note that as the equation for the line is given by \( !{$a}x + !{$b}y + 
$c = 0 \), any point on the line will have the form:

\[
  \left( x, \frac{-!{$a}x-$c}{$b} \right)
\]

So, the initial formula we will use to find the distance between such
a point and the fixed point \( ( $d, $e ) \) is just the distance formula
for these two points.  Namely:

\[
   f(x) = \sqrt{ ($d-x)^2 + \left($e-\frac{-!{$a}x-$c}{$b}\right)^2 }
\]

To make things easier on ourselves, we note that when we minimize the
distance, we also minimize the square of the distance.  So we will
actually work with a function \( g(x) \) defined by:

\[
  g(x) = ($d-x)^2 + \left($e-\frac{-!{$a}x-$c}{$b}\right)^2
\]

Now, we wish to minimize \( g(x) \), so we will find its 
derivative and solve for 0.  This will give us the \( x \) value
of the point on the line closest to our fixed point.  The reason
that we work with \( g(x) \)--the square of the distance--instead
of the actual distance \( f(x) \) is that it is now
relatively easy to find the derivative.

\[
  g'(x) = 2($d-x)(-1) + 2\left($e - \frac{-!{$a}x-$c}{$b}\right)\left(\frac{$a}{$b}\right)
\]

Now, setting this equal to 0 we get:

\[
  \begin{align*}
    g'(x) & = -2($d-x) + \frac{2($a)}{$b}\left($e - \frac{-!{$a}x-$c}{$b}\right) \\ \\
      0   & = \{ -2*$d \} + 2x + \frac{ \{ 2*$a*$e \}}{$b} +
              \frac{ \{2*$a*$a\}x}{ \{$b**2\} } +
              \frac{ \{2*$a*$c\}}{ \{$b**2\} } \\ \\
    -2x-\frac{ \{2*$a**2\}x}{ \{$b**2\} } &= 
              \frac{ \{-2*$d*$b**2\} + \{2*$a*$e*$b\} +
                     \{2*$a*$c\}}{ \{$b**2\} } \\ \\
    x\left(\frac{ \{$b**2\} + \{$a**2\} }{ \{$b**2\}}\right) &=
              \frac{ -\{$a*$e*$b - $d*$b**2 + $a*$c\} }{ \{$b**2\} } \\ \\
    x &= \frac{ -\{$a*$e*$b - $d*$b**2 + $a*$c\} }{ \{ $b**2 + $a**2 \} }
       = !{\{$d-$t*$a\}:%5.4f}
  \end{align*}
\]

Now this is the \( x \) value at which the distance is at either
a maximum or a minimum.  However, it should be clear that
the distance is never at a maximum (just keep moving further
along the line), so this must be a minimum.  Then, it is a 
simple matter to plug this \( x \) value into the equation of 
the line to get the point:

\[ \big(!{\{$d-$t*$a\}:%5.4f}, !{\{$e-$t*$b\}:%5.4f}\big) \]

Which is the solution.
