A rancher wants to fence in an area of $a1 square feet in a rectangular field and then
divide it in half with a fence down the middle parallel to one side. What is the shortest
length of fence that the rancher can use? \{ans_rule(30) \}

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOF'));
$SOL $BR

Let \(x\) be the length of the rectangular field, and \( y\) the width.  
We need to write an expression for the length of fence used in terms of
one of these two values.  As we are told that the area of the entire field
is $a1, we have the following equation:
$PAR
\[
   xy = $a1 \Rightarrow y = \frac{$a1}{x}
\]
Therefore, we can write an expression for the perimeter of the fence
as \( P(x)= 2x + 2\big(\frac{$a1}{x}\big) \).  Now the actual length of fence
used is the perimeter plus the length of fence down the center of the
field.  For simplicity, say that the fence down the center runs parallel 
to the side of length \( x \) (it won't matter which side we choose in 
the end, as we can just swap variable names \( x \) and \( y \)).
$PAR
Then, our new expression for the total length of fencing used is
\( L(x) = 2x+\frac{\{2*$a1\}}{x} + x = 3x + \frac{\{2*$a1\}}{x} \).  We 
want to minimize this value, so we will take the derivative and set it 
equal to 0.  The derivative of \( L(x) \) is:
$PAR
\[
  L'(x) = 3 - \frac{\{2*$a1\}}{x^2}
\]
$PAR
Setting this equal to 0 and solving for \( x \), we get:
$PAR
\[
  \begin{aligned}
    3 - \frac{\{2*$a1\}}{x^2} & = 0 \\
    \frac{\{2*$a1\}}{x^2} & = 3 \\
    3x^2 & = \{2*$a1\} \\
    x^2 & = \frac{\{2*$a1\}}{3} \\
    x & = \sqrt{\frac{\{2*$a1\}}{3}} \approx !{\{sqrt(2*$a1/3)\}:%5.4f} \\
  \end{aligned}
\]
Now, plugging this into our formula for the length of fence used, we get:
$PAR
\[
  L(\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}($a1)}) = !{$ans:%5.4f}
\]
