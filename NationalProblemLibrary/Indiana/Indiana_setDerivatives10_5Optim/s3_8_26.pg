A Norman window has the shape of a semicircle atop a rectangle so that the diameter
of the semicircle is equal to the width of the rectangle.  What is the area of the largest
possibe Norman window with a perimeter of $p1 feet? \{ans_rule(30) \}

$SOL $BR

To solve this maximization problem, we must find a formula for the area 
of the window in terms of one of its dimensions.  Let \( x \) be the 
half of the width of the rectangular portion of the window.  Then, if \( h 
\) is the height of the rectangular portion, the area is given by
\( 2xh + \frac{{\pi}{x}^2}{2} \) (since we have half of a circle on top of the 
rectangle).
$PAR
Now, we need to find an expression for the height of the rectangular 
portion of the window in terms of the width, \( 2x \).  This is where we 
use the information that the entire window should have a perimeter of 
$p1 feet.  The perimeter of the window is given by \( 2x+2h+{\pi}x \),
again since we are only using half of a circle.  Setting this equation
equal to $p1 and solving for \( h \), we get:
$PAR
\[
  \begin{align*}
    2x+2h+{\pi}x & = $p1 \\
    2h & = $p1 - 2x - {\pi}x \\
    h & = \frac{$p1 -2x - {\pi}x}{2} \\
  \end{align*}
\]
$PAR
Plugging this into our expression, we get a formula for the area of the 
window in terms of the width of the rectangular portion.  That is:
$PAR
\[
   a(x) = 2x\left(\frac{$p1-2x-{\pi}x}{2}\right) + \frac{{\pi}x^2}{2}
        = {$p1}x - 2x^2 - \frac{\pi}{2}x^2
\]
$PAR
Now, taking the derivative of this and solving for 0, we get:
$PAR
\[
  \begin{align*}
    a'(x) & = 45 - 4x - {\pi}x \\
    a'(x) & = 0 \\
    45 - 4x - {\pi}x & = 0 \\
    4x+{\pi}x & = 45 \\
    x(4+\pi) & = 45 \\
    x & = \frac{45}{4+\pi} \approx !{\{ 45/(4+3.14159265) \}:%5.4f} \\
  \end{align*}
\]
$PAR
Checking will show that this is in fact a local maximum, so that the 
maximum area of the window can be found by plugging this value of \( x \) 
into the formula for area.  That is:
$PAR
\[
  a(!{\{ 45/(4+3.14159265)\}:%5.4f}) \approx !{$ans:%5.2f}
\]
