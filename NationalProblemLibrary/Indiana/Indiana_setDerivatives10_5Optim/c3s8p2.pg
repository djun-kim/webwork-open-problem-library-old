A rectangle is inscribed with its base on the \(x\)  axis and its
upper corners on the parabola
\( y= $a1 - x^2\).  What are the dimensions of such a rectangle with the greatest
possible area?

$SOL $BR
To solve this problem, we need to find an expression for the area of the 
rectangle in terms of one of its dimensions, and then use derivatives to
maximize this area.  First, however, we can simply things quite a bit by 
noting that the parabola given by \( y = $a1 - x^2\) is symmetric about 
the \(y\)-axis.  Therefore, the inscribed rectangle will also be symmetric 
about the \(y\)-axis.  So it is enough to find the dimensions of half of this 
rectangle and double the x value.
$PAR
Our rectangle will therefore have the bottom left corner \( (0,0) \) and the top
right corner \((x,$a1-x^2)\) where \( x \) is the width of the rectangle, 
and \( $a1 - x^2 \) is its height.  Thus, the area of the rectangle is
given by \( f(x) = x($a1-x^2) = {$a1}x-x^3 \) where \( x \) is the width 
of the rectangle.  We now find the derivative of this and solve for zero 
to find critical points.
$PAR
The derivative is \( f'(x) = $a1 - 3x^2 \).  Setting this equal to 0 and 
recalling that we are talking about widths, so that all \( x \) values 
should be positive, we get:
$PAR
\[
  \begin{aligned}
    f'(x) & = 0 \\
    $a1 - 3x^2 & = 0 \\
    3x^2 & = $a1 \\
     x^2 & = \frac{$a1}{3} \\
     x & = \sqrt{\frac{$a1}{3}} \\
  \end{aligned}
\]
$PAR

It is easy to check that the second derivative of \( f(x) \) is negative everywhere, 
so this is a maximum of \(f(x)\).  Therefore, this is the width of the rectangle with the
maximum area. Actually, it is the width of half of that rectangle, since we were
ignoring the half on the left side of the y-axis. So the width of the whole rectangle is \( 
2\sqrt{\frac{$a1}{3}} \approx !{$ans1:%5.3f} \).  The height is given by 
plugging \( \sqrt{\frac{$a1}{3}} \) into the formula for the porabloa, giving
\( 8 - (\sqrt{\frac{$a1}{3}})^2  = 8 - \frac{$a1}{3} \approx 
!{$ans2:%5.3f} \).
