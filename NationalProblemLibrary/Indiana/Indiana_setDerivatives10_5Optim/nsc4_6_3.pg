SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOF'));
$SOL $BR

To solve this problem, we will need to write a formula for the volume
of the box in terms of one of its dimensions, and then use derivatives
to find the dimensions at which the box has a maximum volume.  Let \( x 
\) be the length of the sides of the square base.  Then, if \( h \) is 
the height of the box, the volume is given by \( x^2h \).  We need to 
find an expression for the height \( h \) in terms of \( x \).
$PAR
This is where we use our information about the amount of material used
in constructing the box.  If the base of the box has sides of length \( x 
\), then \( x^2 \) square centimeters of material are used to make the 
base. Therefore, we have only \( $area - x^2 \) square centimeters of 
material left to make the sides, of which there are four.  Each of the 
sides uses \( hx \) square centimeters of material.  Therefore, we
get the formula:
$PAR
\[
    $area-x^2 = 4(hx) \Rightarrow h = \frac{$area-x^2}{4x}
\]
$PAR
Plugging this into our formula for volume, we can now write out \( v(x) \)
as:
$PAR
\[
    v(x) = x^2\big(\frac{$area-x^2}{4x}\big) = 
           \frac{{$area}x - x^3}{4}
\]
$PAR
Now, we take the derivative of this expression, using the rules for
taking derivatives of polynomials, to get \( v'(x) = \frac{$area}{4} - 
\frac{3}{4}x^2 \).  Setting this equal to 0 will give us the critical
points.  When solving, remember that this is a real world situation, so 
we can not have a negative value for \(x \) (which is a length).
$PAR
\[
  \begin{align*}
    v'(x) & = 0 \\
    \frac{$area}{4} - \frac{3}{4}x^2 & = 0 \\
    \frac{3}{4}x^2 & = \frac{$area}{4} \\
    x^2 & = \frac{$area}{3} \\
    x & = \sqrt{\frac{$area}{3}} = !{$width:%5.2f} \\
  \end{align*}
\]

Now, plugging this width into our formula for volume, \( v(x) \), we get
the maximal volume of \(v(!{$width:%5.2f}) = !{$vol:%5.2f} \).
