Since this series contains only positive terms, convergence is the same as
absolute convergence.  So we apply the ratio test and find that it is
absolutely convergent:
	\[
	\begin{align*}
	\lim_{n\to\infty}
		\left|\frac{\left(\frac{\left(n+1\right)^$a0}{$b0^{n+1}}\right)}
			{\left(\frac{n^$a0}{$b0^n}\right)}\right|
	&=
	\lim_{n\to\infty}
		\left|\frac{\left(\frac{n+1}{n}\right)^$a0}{$b0}\right|	\\\\
	&=
	\frac{ \displaystyle \lim_{n\to\infty} \left(\frac{n+1}{n}\right)^$a0 }{$b0}	\\\\
	&=
	\frac{1}{$b0} < 1
	\end{align*}
	\]

EOT
}
if ($slice[$i] == 1) {
&SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));

We first rewrite this series to be something more manageable:
	\[
	\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n $a1^{n-1}}{$a1^{n+1}n^{\frac{1}{$b0}}}
	=	\frac{1}{$a1^2}\cdot\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n^{\frac{1}{$b0}}}
	\]
Now we can see this clearly converges by the alternating series test, because
the \((-1)^n\) makes it alternating, and the denominator grows unbounded
while the numerator is constant, making the terms approach \(0\).  We also
can see that it does not converge absolutely, either by considering it as a
p-series (see box #1, p.716) or by comparison test with
\(\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n}\).

EOT
}
if ($slice[$i] == 2) {
&SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));

We can see this series is absolutely convergent by comparison test to a
simple geometric series we know converges:
	\[
	\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n}
	$soln_line1 \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{$a2^n n!}
	\]

EOT
}
if ($slice[$i] == 3) {
&SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));

First we simplify the series:
	\[
	\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(n+2)!}{$a3^n n!}
	=	\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(n+2)(n+1)}{$a3^n}
	=	\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n^2+3n+1}{$a3^n}
	\]

Because this series is positive terms only, convergence is the same as
absolute convergence.  Thus we test with the ratio test, and find it to
be convergent, and therefore absolutely convergent:
	\[
	\begin{align*}
	\lim_{n\to\infty}
		\left|\frac{\left(\frac{(n+1)^2+3(n+1)+1}{$a3^{n+1}}\right)}
			{\left(\frac{n^2+3n+1}{$a3^n}\right)}\right|
	&=
	\lim_{n\to\infty}
		\left|\frac{\left(\frac{n^2+\cdots}{n^2+\cdots}\right)}{$a3}\right|
		\\\\
	&=
	\frac{1}{$a3} \lim_{n\to\infty}
		\left(\frac{n^2+\cdots}{n^2+\cdots}\right)	\\\\
	&=
	\frac{1}{$a3} < 1
	\end{align*}
	\]
The reason we don't care here about the polynomials that begin with \(n^2\) 
is because all we need to know is their highest-power term, because that's
what determines the limit.  Since both polynomials were \(2^{nd}\)-degree,
and both had \(1\) for the leading coefficient, the limit was
\(\frac{1}{1}=1\).

EOT
}
if ($slice[$i] == 4) {
&SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));

This series diverges.  We can tell this because if it were to converge,
the terms would need to approach \(0\), and we can show that they do not.
In fact, we can show that all the terms after the \(($a4^3)^{th}\),
\(\frac{n!}{$a4^n} > 1\), as follows:
	\[
	\begin{align*}
	n!
	&=
	n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(2)(1)	\\\\
	&=
	(1\cdot n)(2\cdot(n-1))(3\cdot(n-2))\cdots	\\\\
	&\geq
	n^{\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor}	\\\\
	&\geq
	\left($a4^3\right)^{\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor}	\\\\
	&\geq
	$a4^{2-1} = $a4
	\end{align*}
	\]
And since every \(n!\) for \(n\geq $a4^3\) is greater than or equal to \($a4\),
every term of the series starting with the \(($a4^3)^{th}\) is greater than
or equal to \(1\), making the series divergent.
