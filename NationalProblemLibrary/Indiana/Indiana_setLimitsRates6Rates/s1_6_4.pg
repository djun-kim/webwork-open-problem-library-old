SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOF'));
$SOL $BR
The slope of the tangent line to a function \( f(x) \) at a point \( (x,y) \)
is given by the derivative of \( f \) at \( x \).  Thus, the first step is to 
find the derivative of \( f(x) = \frac{ $a1 }{ x } = $a1 x^{-1}  \).  Using 
the rules  for finding the derivatives of polynomials, we get 
\( f'(x) = - \frac{ $a1 }{ x^2 } \). Therefore, \( f'($x1) = !{$m1:%5.4f} \).

Now, to find the equation of the tangent line, note that being tangent to 
\( f(x) \) at the point \( ($x1, !{$y1:%5.4f}) \) means that the line goes
through this point.  We already know that the slope of the line is 
\( !{$m1:%5.4f} \).  So using the point-slope form of a line yields 
\( (y-!{$y1:%5.4f}) = !{$m1:%5.4f}(x-$x1) \) or \( y = !{$m1:%5.4f} x + 
!{$ans:%5.4f} \).
