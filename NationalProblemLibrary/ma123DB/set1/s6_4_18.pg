BEGIN_TEXT
 A trough is \($l\) meters long, $w meters wide, and \($d\) meters deep. 
 The vertical cross-section of the trough parallel to an end 
 is shaped like an isoceles triangle (with height \($d\) meters,
 and base, on top, of length \(\)$w meters).  
 The trough is full of water (density \(1000 \ \textrm{kg}/\textrm{m}^3\) ).   
 Find the amount of work in joules required to empty the trough  
 by pumping the water over the top. 
 (Note: Use \(g=9.8 \ \textrm{m}/\textrm{s}^2\) as the acceleration due to gravity.)
