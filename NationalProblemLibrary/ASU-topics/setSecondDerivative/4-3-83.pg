The marketing research department for a computer company used a
large city to test market their new product.  They found that the
relationship between the price \(p\) and the demand \(x\) was
given approximately by
\[ p = $a - $b x^2.  \]

Find \(R(x)\), the revenue function.
$PAR
\(R(x)\) = \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR
$BR
Now use the revenue function to do the following:
$BR
$BR
(A) Find the average of the \(x\) values of all local maxima of
\(R(x)\).
$BR
Note: If there are no local maxima, enter -1000.
$PAR
Average of \(x\) values = \{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR
$BR
(B) Find the average of the \(x\) values of all local minima of
\(R(x)\).
$BR
Note: If there are no local minima, enter -1000.
$PAR
Average of \(x\) values = \{ans_rule(20)\}

(C) Use interval notation to indicate where \( R(x) \) is concave up.

$PAR
{\bf Note:} When using interval notation in WeBWorK, remember
that:
\begin{itemize}
\item You use 'I' for \(\infty\) and '-I' for \(-\infty\).
\item 'U' for the union symbol.
\item If you have extra boxes, fill each in with an 'x'.
