BEGIN_TEXT
The graph of the function 
\( y = $b + (x+$a)^2 \)
can be obtained from the graph of
\( y = x^2 \)
by a combination of two actions.  First we
$BR$BR

(a) shift the graph of \(f(x)\) to the right $a units;
$BR
(b) shift the graph of \(f(x)\) to the left $a units;
$BR
(c) vertically stretch the graph of \(f(x)\) by a factor $a;
$BR
(d) vertically shrink the graph of \(f(x)\) by a factor $a;
$BR$BR
Your answer is (input a, b, c, or d) \{ans_rule(15) \}

BEGIN_TEXT
Then we
$BR$BR
(e) shift the resulting graph upward $b units;
$BR
(f) shift the resulting graph downward $b units;
$BR
(g) horizontally stretch the resulting graph by a factor $b;
$BR
(h) horizontally shrink the resulting graph  by a factor $b;
$BR$BR
Your answer is (input e, f, g,  or h) \{ans_rule(15) \}
