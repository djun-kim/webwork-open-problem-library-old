BEGIN_TEXT
The revenue for selling \(x\) units of a product is \(R = 40x\).
The cost of producing \(x\) units is \(C = 20x + $a\).
In order to obtain a profit, the revenue must be greater than the cost, so
we want to know, for what values of \(x\) will this product return a profit.

To obtain a profit, the number of units must be greater than
\{ans_rule(20)\}.
