A box is to be made out of a $a by $b piece of cardboard.  Squares
of equal size will be cut out of each corner, and then the ends
and sides will be folded up to form a box with an open top.  Find
the length \(L\), width \(W\), and height \(H\) of the resulting
box that maximizes the volume.  (Assume that \(W \leq L\)).
