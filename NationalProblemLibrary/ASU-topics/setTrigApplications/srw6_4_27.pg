A communication tower (the side CB) is located at the top (the point C) of 
a steep hill. 
The angle of inclination of the hill is 58 degrees. A guy wire is to be 
attached to the top (the point B) of the tower and to the ground (the point A), 
$b m downhill from the base of the tower (the side AC). The angle
\( \angle BAC \) in the figure is 12 degrees.
