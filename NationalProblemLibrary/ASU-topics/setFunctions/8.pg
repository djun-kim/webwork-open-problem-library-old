BEGIN_TEXT
On a remote tropical island, the average life expectancy of women is given
by the model 
\[y= \sqrt{6000+67x-2.2x^2+.04x^3} ,\]

where \(y\) is the "average life expectancy for a woman" 
since 1980.  Thus, \(x\) is the number of years since 1980.  
What is the predicted average life expectancy of a woman in the 
year $year?
	$PAR
	Average Life Expectancy = \{ans_rule(40)\}

# Tell WeBWork how to test if answers are right.  These should come in the

# "answer evaluator" to use, and the correct answer.
