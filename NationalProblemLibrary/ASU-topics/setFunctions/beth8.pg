BEGIN_TEXT
A company that makes thing-a-ma-bobs has a start up cost of $DOLLAR $a.  It costs the company $DOLLAR $b to make each
thing-a-ma-bob and the company charges $DOLLAR $c for each thing-a-ma-bob.  Let \(x\)
represent the number of thing-a-ma-bobs made.
	$PAR
Write the cost function for this company.
	\(C(x)\) = \{ans_rule(40)\} dollars
        $PAR
Write the revenue function for this company.
        \(R(x)\) = \{ans_rule(40)\} dollars
        $PAR
Write the profit function for this company.
        \(P(x) = R(x) - C(x)\) = \{ans_rule(40)\} dollars
        $PAR
What is the minimum number of thing-a-ma-bobs that the company must pruduce and sell to make a profit?
         answer = \{ans_rule(40)\}
