It is known that the white shark grows to a mean length of 20 feet; however, one marine biologist believes that great white sharks off the Bermuda coast grow much longer.  To test this claim, full-grown white sharks were captured, measured, and then set free.  However, this was a difficult, costly and very dangerous task, so only four sharks were actually sampled.  Their
lengths were 24, 25, 26 and 20 feet.  Do the data provide sufficient evidence to support the claim?  To test this claim you need to use","none of these because the required assumptions are not met");
