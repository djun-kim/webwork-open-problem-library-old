BEGIN_TEXT

A random sample of \( $n1 \) cars owned by students had a mean age of \( $x1 \) years and a 
standard deviation of \( $s1 \) years, while a random sample of \( $n2 \) cars owned by faculty have a mean age of \( $x2 \) years and a standard deviation of \( $s2 \) years. $BR

1. \( \ \) Use a \( $alpha \) significance level to test the claim that cars owned by students are 
older than cars owned by faculty. $BR

The test statistic is \{ans_rule(35)\} $BR

The critical value is \{ans_rule(35)\} $BR


\{ $mc -> print_q() \} $BR
\{ $mc -> print_a() \} $BR


2. \( \ \) Construct a \( $perc\)$PERCENT confidence interval estimate of the difference
\( \mu_1 - \mu_2 \), where \( \mu_1 \) is the mean age of student cars and \( \mu_2 \)
is the mean age of faculty cars.

\{ans_rule(35)\}\( < (\mu_1 - \mu_2) < \)\{ans_rule(35)\}
