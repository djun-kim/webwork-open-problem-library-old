a)  For 30 randomly selected Rolling Stones concerts, the mean gross earnings is  $mean million dollars.  Assuming a population standard deviation gross earnings of $stdev million dollars, obtain a 99% confidence interval for the mean gross earnings of all Rolling Stones concerts (in millions). $BR
Confidence interval: (\{ans_rule(10)\},\{ans_rule(10)\}). $BR
