A retail store estimates that weekly sales \(s\) and weekly
advertising costs \(x\) (both in dollars) are related by
\[
    s = $a - $b e^{-$c x}.
\]
The current weekly advertising costs are 2000 dollars and these
costs are increasing at the rate of 300 dollars per week.  Find
the current rate of change of sales.
