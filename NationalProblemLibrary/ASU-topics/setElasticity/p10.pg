BEGIN_TEXT
Currently, 10,000 people take city buses each day and pay 2 dollars for a ticket.
The number of people taking city buses at price p dollars per ticket is given
\( x = 5000\sqrt{6-p} \) 
$BR
(a) Evaluate the elasticity at $a.
\(E($a)=\) \{ans_rule(10) \}
$BR
(b) Currently, the price per ticket is 2 dollars. Should the price be raised in order to increase revenue?
 Enter 1 for $BITALIC Yes $EITALIC or 2 for $BITALIC No $EITALIC.
\(answer=\) \{ans_rule(10) \}
$BR
(c) For what value of p, the demand is unitary.
\(p=\) \{ans_rule(10) \}
