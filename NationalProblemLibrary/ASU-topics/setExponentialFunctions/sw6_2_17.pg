BEGIN_TEXT
The number of bacteria in a culture is given by the function
\[
n(t)=$p e^{$r t}
\]
where \(t\) is measured in hours.
$BR
(a) What is the relative rate of growth of this bacterium population?
$BR
Your answer is \{ans_rule(10) \} percent
$BR
(b) What is the initial population of the culture (at t=0)? 
$BR
Your answer is \{ans_rule(15) \}
$BR
(c) How many bacteria will the culture contain at time t=5? 
$BR
Your answer is (round off to the nearest integer) \{ans_rule(15) \}
