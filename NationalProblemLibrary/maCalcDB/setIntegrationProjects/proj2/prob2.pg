BEGIN_TEXT
This problem is a reprise of Problem 1 with 1.1 replaced everywhere
by 1.001
$PAR
Consider the exponential equation
\[1.001^x = 2\]
Let \(N\) and \(N+1\) be the two INTEGERS which bracket the
solution (ie. \(1.001^N<2\) and \(1.001^{N+1}>2\)). Then
$BR
\(N\) = \{ ans_rule()\}
$PAR

Now consider the exponential equation
\[1.001^y = 3\]
Let \(N\) and \(N+1\) be the two INTEGERS which bracket the
solution (ie. \(1.001^N<3\) and \(1.001^{N+1}>3\)). Then
$BR
\(N\) = \{ ans_rule()\}
$PAR

Using the integers \(N\) as approximations to the actual solutions
\(x\) and \(y\) of the exponential equations above we find that the
exponential equation
\[2^z =3\]
has approximate solution \(z\approx\frac{m}{n}\) where
$BR
\(m\) = \{ ans_rule()\}
$BR

and \(n\) = \{ ans_rule()\}
$BR

To see how good an approximation \(\frac{m}{n}\) is to the actual
solution we compute
$BR
\(2^{\frac{m}{n}}\) = \{ ans_rule()\}
$BR
and check how close it is to 3.
$PAR

This problem illustrates John Napier's (1550-1617) approach to solving
exponential equations and how he came to discover natural logarithms.
Note that computing INTEGER powers of 1.001 can be done easily by hand
(given enough free time), as multiplication by 1.001 requires only shifting
and adding.
