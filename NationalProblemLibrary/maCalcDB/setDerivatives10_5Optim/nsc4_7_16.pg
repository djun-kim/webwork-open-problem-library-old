BEGIN_TEXT
The manager of a large apartment complex knows from experience that $max_rooms units
will be occupied if the rent is $min_rent dollars per month. A market survey suggests that,
on the average, one additional unit will remain vacant
for each $demand_rate dollar increase in rent.  Similarly, one additional unit will be occupied for each $demand_rate dollar
decrease in rent.  What rent should the manager charge to maximize
revenue?
