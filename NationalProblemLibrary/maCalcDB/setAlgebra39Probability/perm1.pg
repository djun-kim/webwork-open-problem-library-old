An algebra class has $kids students and $kids desks.  For the sake of variety, 
students change the seating arrangement each day.  How many days must pass 
before the class must repeat a seating arrangement?

Suppose the desks are arranged in rows of 4.  How many seating arrangements are
there that put Larry, Moe, Curly, and Shemp in the front seats?$BR$BR

There are \{ans_rule(15)\} seating arrangements that put them in the front 
seats.

What is the probability that Larry, Moe, Curly and Shemp are sitting in the 
front seats?

The probability is \{ans_rule(15)\}.
