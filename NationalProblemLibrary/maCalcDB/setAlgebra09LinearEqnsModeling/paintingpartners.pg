Mutt and Jeff need to paint a fence.  Mutt can do the job alone $A hours faster
than Jeff.  If together they work for $B hours and finish only 
\( \frac{$num}{$den}\) of the
job, how long would Jeff need to do the job alone?
$BR $BR
Your answer must be a number.  No arithmetic operations are allowed.
$BR $BR
It would take Jeff \{ans_rule(10)\} hours to do the job alone.
