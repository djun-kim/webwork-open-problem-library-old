The rule of 72 states that if an investment earns \(P\) $PERCENT interest per 
year, it will take approximately \(72/P\) years for your money to double.
$BR$BR

You invest $start at $rate $PERCENT interest annually.
$BR$BR
According to the rule of 72, what is the doubling time, in years, 
for this investment  \{ans_rule(10)\}
$BR$BR
Use the doubling time to find a formula  for \(V(t)\), the value of your 
investment at time \(t\).
\(V(t) = \) \{ans_rule(20)\}
$BR$BR
According to the doubling time, how much will your investment be worth after $k years? \{ans_rule(10)\}
$BR
$BR
Use the compound interest formula to find how much the investment will be worth after $k years. \{ans_rule(10)\}.
$BR$BR
You may notice that your two values for the investment's worth after $k years 
are different.  That is because the doubling time you found with the rule of 72 is only an approximation.  If the approximation were better, the two values 
would be the same.
