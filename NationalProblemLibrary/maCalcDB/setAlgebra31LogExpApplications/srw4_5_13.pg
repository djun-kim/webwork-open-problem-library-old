BEGIN_TEXT
An infectious strain of bacteria increases in number at a relative
growth rate of $a percent per hour. When a certain critical number of bacteria 
are present in the bloodstream, a person becomes ill. If a single bacterium 
infects a person, the critical level is reached in 24 hours. 
How long will it take for the critical level to be reached 
if the same person is infected with 10 bacteria?
$BR
Your answer is \{ans_rule(15) \} hours.
