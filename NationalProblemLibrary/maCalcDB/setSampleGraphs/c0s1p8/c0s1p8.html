Many of the problems we use in our calculus classes include 'static' graphs.  One or more graphs are prepared ahead of time using a graphing program such as Mathematica or Matlab or some other graphing calculator.  
$PAR
The graph below was created using the program Xfunctions developed
by David Ecks.

The function to the left represents the velocity of a race car as it travels a linear track. Negative velocities mean the car is backing up.  (The letters in each answer must be in alphabetical order with 
no spaces between the letters.)!
