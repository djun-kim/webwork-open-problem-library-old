The three series \( \sum A_n \), \( \sum B_n \),
and \( \sum C_n \) have terms
\[ A_n = \frac{1}{n^{$a}}, \quad
B_n = \frac{1}{n^{$b}}, \quad
C_n = \frac{1}{n}. \]
Use the Limit Comparison Test to compare the following
series to any of the above series.  For each of the series
below, you must enter two letters.  The first is
the letter (A,B, or C) of the series above that it can
be legally compared to with the Limit Comparison Test.
The second is C if the given series converges, or D if it
diverges.  So for instance, if you believe the series
converges and can be compared with series C above, you
would enter CC; or if you believe it diverges and can be
compared with series A, you would enter AD.
