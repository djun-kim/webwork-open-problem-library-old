BEGIN_TEXT
The graph of the function 
\( y = - $a f(x) \)
can be obtained from the graph of
\( y = f(x) \)
by one of the following actions:
$BR
(a) horizontally stretching the graph of \(f(x)\) by a factor $a;
$BR
(b) horizontally shrinking the graph of \(f(x)\) by a factor $a;
$BR
(c) vertically stretching the graph of \(f(x)\) by a factor $a;
$BR
(d) vertically shrinking the graph of \(f(x)\) by a factor $a;
$BR
Your answer is (input a, b, c, or d) \{ans_rule(15) \}
$BR
END_TEXT

ANS(std_str_cmp($ans1));

BEGIN_TEXT
Then followed by one of the following actions:

(e) reflecting the resulting graph in \(x\)-axis;

(f) reflecting the resulting graph in \(y\)-axis;

Your answer is (input e or f) \{ans_rule(15) \}
