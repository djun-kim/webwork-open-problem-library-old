BEGIN_TEXT
The graph of the function 
\( y = f(x-$a)+$b \)
can be obtained from the graph of
\( y = f(x) \)
by one of the following actions:
$BR
(a) shifting the graph of \(f(x)\) to the right $a units;
$BR
(b) shifting the graph of \(f(x)\) to the left $a units;
$BR
(c) vertically stretching the graph of \(f(x)\) by a factor $a;
$BR
(d) vertically shrinking the graph of \(f(x)\) by a factor $a;
$BR
Your answer is (input a, b, c, or d) \{ans_rule(15) \}
$BR

Then followed by one of the following actions:

(e) shifting the resulting graph upward $b units;

(f) shifting the resulting graph downward $b units;

(g) horizontally stretching the resulting graph by a factor $b;

(h) horizontally shrinking the resulting graph by a factor 1/$b;

Your answer is (input e, f, g,  or h) \{ans_rule(15) \}
