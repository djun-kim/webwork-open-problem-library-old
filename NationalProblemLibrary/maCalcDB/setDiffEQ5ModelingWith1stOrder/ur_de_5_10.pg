Suppose that a population develops according to the logistic equation 
\[ \frac{dP}{dt} = $k P - $b P^2\]
where \(t\) is measured in weeks.

(a) What is the carriying capacity? \{ans_rule(20)\}
$BR $BR 
(b) Is the solution increasing or decreasing when \(P\) is between \(0\) and the carriying capacity? \{pop_up_list(['?','increasing', 'decreasing'])\}
