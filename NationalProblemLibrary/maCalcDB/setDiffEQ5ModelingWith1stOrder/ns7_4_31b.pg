BEGIN_TEXT
A tank contains \($a\) L of pure water.
Solution that contains \($b\) kg of sugar per
liter enters the tank at the rate \($c\) L/min, and is thoroughly
mixed into it.
The new solution drains out of
the tank at the same rate. $BR
(a) How much sugar is in the tank at the begining? $BR 
\(y(0) = \) \{ans_rule(5) \} (kg) $BR $BR 
(b) Find the amount of sugar after t  minutes. $BR
\(y(t) =\) \{ ans_rule(40) \} (kg)
$BR $BR 
(c) As t becomes large, what value is \( y(t) \) approaching ?  In other words, calculate the following limit.  
\( \displaystyle  \lim_{t \to \infty} y(t) = \) \{ans_rule(10) \} (kg) $BR
