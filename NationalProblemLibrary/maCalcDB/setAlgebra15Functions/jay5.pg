BEGIN_TEXT
A company produces very unusual CD's for which the variable cost is $DOLLAR$a per CD 
and the fixed costs are $DOLLAR$b.  They will sell the CD's for $DOLLAR$c each.
Let \(x\) be the number of CD's produced.
$BR
Write the total cost \(C\) as a function of the number of CD's produced.  
$BR
\(C =\)$DOLLAR \{ ans_rule(15)\}
$BR $BR
Write the total revenue \(R\) as a function of the number of CD's produced.  
$BR
\(R =\)$DOLLAR \{ ans_rule(15)\}
$BR
$BR
Write the total profit \(P\) as a function of the number of CD's produced.  
$BR
\(P =\)$DOLLAR \{ ans_rule(15)\}
$BR
Find the number of CD's which must be produced to break even.  
$BR
The number of CD's which must be produced to break even is \{ ans_rule(15)\}
