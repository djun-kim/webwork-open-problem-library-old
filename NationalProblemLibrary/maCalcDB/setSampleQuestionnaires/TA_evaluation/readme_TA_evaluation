Readme file for using modifying and using the TA evaluation form

1. You can use the files in this subdirectory as samples when writing your own questionnaires.

2. TA_evaluation_fall02.pg is a standard pg problem file except that answers are
emailed to the desinated email address(es).

3. If you want to use this sample with minimal changes

    a) You should modify the list of courses and TA's on lines 49-56, 70-133, and 138-208.
    b) Modify lines 365 entering correct email addresses and subject line for the email

4. You also have to modify the webworkCourse.ph file adding a line sililar to
 $PG_environment{'ALLOW_MAIL_TO'} = ['gage@math.rochester.edu','apizer@math.rochester.edu'];
to enable email.

5. The script compile_TA_results_fall00.pl compiles the results and produces 4 files:

 The script parses results generated by TA_evaluation_fall00.pg and summarizes them
 into 4 files.  The orginal files have the format described at the end of this file.

 The required inputs are the html source of the questionnaire, a file containing all the
 email responses concatenated into one file, and a base file name [e.g. TA_evalation_fall02]
 (without an extension) for the four output files [the four output files will be e.g.
 TA_evalation_fall02.html, TA_evalation_fall02_summary.html, TA_evalation_fall02.xls, and
 TA_evalation_fall02.txt].

 TA_evalation_fall02_summary.html is a small file containing a summary of the responses of question 5
 which is the overall evaluation and for question C "Would you take a recitation with this TA again?"

 TA_evalation_fall02.html is a large file containing detailed information on each TA along with all
 student written comments. The comments are ordered in the approximate order of from better to worst.

 TA_evalation_fall02.xls is a large file suitable for importation to a spreadsheet program such as Excel.
 It contains all numerical data.

 TA_evalation_fall02.txt is a large file suitable for importation to a spreadsheet program such as Excel.
 It contains all written comments.  The numerical and written data are keyed to each other.

 6. The required html source of the questionnaire (not the .pg file TA_evaluation_fall02.pg!)
 can be easily obtained by viewing the questionnaire in a browser and saving the html source.
 When you do this, login as a practice user. If you login as a professor,  the html source
 contains a lot of extra stuff associated with a professor's ability to edit the  file.
 This extra stuff should not cause problems, but it will make the file much larger.

 7. The file containing all the email responses can be obtained by selecting all the responses in
 your email client and saving them to a file.

 8. IMPORTANT:  the script compile_TA_results_fall02.pl uses the html source of the questionnaire
 to obtain data and formatting information.  If you modify the structure of the questionnaire (by
 modifying the .pg file TA_evaluation_fall02.pg), you may have to modify compile_TA_results_fall02.pl
 as well.  Check the following:
 a. $semester in line 50
 b. lines 109, 135-135 (if your source is in latex2html mode) or lines 154, 169-178 (if your source is
    another mode).  This is where the data (course names, TA names and recitation times) is obtained
    from the html source of the questionnaire. If you change the questionnaire, the format of this data
    may change and you may have to modify the code accordingly.
