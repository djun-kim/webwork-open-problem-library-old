Readme file for using modifying and using the WeBWorK evaluation form WeBWorK_questionnaire_fall02.pg

1. You can use the files in this subdirectory as samples when writing your own questionnaires.

2. WeBWorK_questionnaire_fall02.pg is a standard pg problem file except that answers are
emailed to the desinated email address(es).

3. If you want to use this sample with minimal changes

    a) You should modify the list of courses on lines 62 - 70.
    b) Modify lines 626-628 entering correct email addresses and subject line for the email. Uncomment lines
         if you want to send the results to multiple people

4. You also have to modify the webworkCourse.ph file adding a line sililar to
 $PG_environment{'ALLOW_MAIL_TO'} = ['gage@math.rochester.edu','apizer@math.rochester.edu',
 'awda@troi.cc.rochester.edu'];
to enable email.

5. The script compile_questionnaire_results_fall02.pl compiles the results and produces 4 files:

 The script parses results generated by WeBWorK_questionnaire_fall02.pg and summarizes them
 into 4 files.  The orginal files have the format described at the end of this file.

 The the required inputs are the html source of the questionnaire, a file containing all the
 email responses (usually from one course) concatenated into one file, and a base file name
 [e.g. mth161-fall02_results] (without an extension) for the four output files
 [the four output files will be e.g. mth161-fall02_results_full.html, mth161-fall02_results_numeric.html,
 mth161-fall02_results.txt, and mth161-fall02_results.xls].

 mth161-fall02_results_full.html contains the full data including all student comments --- this is the
 most interesting page to look at.

 mth161-fall02_results_numeric.html is a subset of mth161-fall02_results_full.html containing only
 the numeric data.

 mth161-fall02_results.txt and mth161-fall02_results.xls are files containing the student comments
 and numerical data in a form that can be analyzed to your heart's content in any spreadsheet
 program.


 6. The required html source of the questionnaire (not the .pg file WeBWorK_questionnaire_fall02.pg!)
 can be easily obtained by viewing the questionnaire in a browser and saving the html source. When
 you do this, login as a practice user. If you login as a professor, the html source contains a lot
 of extra stuff associated with a professor's ability to edit the file.  This extra stuff should not
 cause problems, but it will make the file much larger.

 7. The file containing all the email responses can be obtained by selecting all the appropiate
 responses in your email client and saving them to a file.

 8. IMPORTANT:  the script compile_questionnaire_results_fall02.pl uses the html source of the questionnaire
 to create its output.  If you modify the structure of the questionnaire (by modifying the .pg file
 WeBWorK_questionnaire_fall02.pg), you may have to modify compile_questionnaire_results_fall02.pl as well.
