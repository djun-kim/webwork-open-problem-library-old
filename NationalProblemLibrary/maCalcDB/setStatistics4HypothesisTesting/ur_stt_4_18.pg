BEGIN_TEXT

When a poultry farmer uses his regular feed, the newborn checkens have normally distributed weights with a mean of 
\( $m \) oz.
In an experiment with an enriched feed mixture, ten chickens are born with the following weights (in ounces). 

\[ $sw[0], \ $sw[1], \ $sw[2], \ $sw[3], \ $sw[4], \ $sw[5], \ $sw[6], \ $sw[7], \ $sw[8], \ $sw[9] \]

Use the \( \alpha=$alpha \) significance level to test the claim that the mean weight is higher with the enriched feed.$BR

The sample mean is \(\overline{x} = \) \{ans_rule(20)\} $BR

The sample standard deviation is \( s = \) \{ans_rule(20)\} $BR

The test statistic is \( t = \) \{ans_rule(20)\} $BR

The critical value is \( t = \) \{ans_rule(20)\} $BR

\{$ mc->print_q() \} $BR

\{ $mc->print_a() \} $BR
