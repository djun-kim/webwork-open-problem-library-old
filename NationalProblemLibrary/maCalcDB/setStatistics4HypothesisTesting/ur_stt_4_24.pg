BEGIN_TEXT
One of the most feared predators in the ocean is the great white shark.  It is known that the
white shark grows to a mean length of \($l\) feet; however, one marine biologist believes
that great white sharks off the Bermuda coast grow much longer.  To test this claim,
full-grown white sharks were captured, measured, and then set free.  However, this was a
difficult, costly and very dangerous task, so only four sharks were actually sampled.  Their
lengths were \($l[0], \ $l[1], \ $l[2], \mbox{and} \ $l[3] \) feet.  Do the data provide
sufficient evidence to support the claim?  Use \(\alpha = $alpha\)$PAR
