BEGIN_TEXT
The effectiveness of a new bug repellent is tested on \($n\) subjects for a 10
hour period.  Based on the number and location of the bug bites, the percentage
of surface area exposed protected from bites was calculated for each of the
subjects.  The results were as follows: $PAR
\( \overline{x} = $mean \) $PERCENT, \( \ s = $s \)$PERCENT $PAR
The new repellent is considered effective if it provides a percent
repellency of at least \($eff\).  Using \(\alpha = $alpha \), construct a
hypothesis test with null hypothesis \(\mu = $e\) and alternative hypothesis \(\mu>$e\) to determine
whether the mean repellency of the new bug relellent is greater than \($eff\) by computing the following:
$PAR 
(a) \( \ \) the degree of freedom \( \ \) \{ans_rule(10)\} $PAR
(b) \( \ \) the critical \(t\) value \( \ \) \{ans_rule(10)\} $PAR
(c) \( \ \) the test statistics \( \ \) \{ans_rule(10)\} $PAR
