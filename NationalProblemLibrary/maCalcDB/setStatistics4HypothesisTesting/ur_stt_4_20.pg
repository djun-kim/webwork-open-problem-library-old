A survey of \( $n \) people who took trips revealed that \( $x \) of them included 
a visit to a theme park. Based on those survery results, a management consultant claims
that less than \( $p \) $PERCENT of trips include a theme park visit. 
Test this claim using the \( \alpha = $alpha \) significance level. $BR

The test statistic is \{ans_rule(30)\} $BR

The critical value is \{ans_rule(30)\} $BR
