BEGIN_TEXT
Let L be the circle in the x-y plane with center the origin and radius $a. $BR
Let S be a moveable circle with radius $b .  S is rolled $BR
along the inside of L without slipping while L remains fixed. $BR
A point P is marked on S before S is rolled and the path of P is studied. $BR
The initial position of P is  ($a,0). $BR
The initial position of the center of S is  ($m,0) . $BR
After S has moved counterclockwise about the origin $BR
through an angle t  the position of P is $BR
\[ x= $m \cos t + $b \cos \left( \frac{$d}{$f} t \right) \]
\[ y= $m \sin t - $b \sin \left( \frac{$d}{$f} t \right) \]
How far does P move before it returns to its initial position? $BR
Hint: You may use the formulas for cos( u+v) and sin( w /2). $BR
S makes several complete revolutions about the origin before P returns
to ($a,0).$BR
