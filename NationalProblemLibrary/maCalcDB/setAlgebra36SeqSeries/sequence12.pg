TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

A Super Happy Fun Ball is dropped from a height of $A feet and rebounds 
\($C/$B\) of the distance from which it fell.
How many times will it bounce before its rebound is less than 1 foot?
$PAR
It will bounce \{ans_rule(20) \} times before its rebound is less than 1 foot.

$PAR

EOT

$ans1 = ceil(log(1/$A)/log($C/$B));

&ANS(std_num_cmp ($ans1));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

How far will the ball travel before it comes to rest on the ground?
$PAR
It will travel \{ans_rule(20) \} feet before it comes to rest on the ground.
$PAR

EOT

$ans2 = $A+2*$A*$C;
&ANS(std_num_cmp($ans2));
