TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
A street light is at the top of a $a1 ft tall pole. A woman 6 ft tall
walks away from the pole with a speed of $b1 ft/sec along a straight path.
How fast is the tip of her shadow moving when she is $c1 ft from the base of the
pole? $BR
\{ans_rule(20) \}
$BR
Note: You should draw a picture of a right triangle with the vertical side representing the pole, and the other end of the hypotenuse representing the tip of the woman's shadow.  Where does the woman fit into this picture?  Label her position as a variable, and label the tip of her shadow as another variable.  You might like to use similar triangles to find a relationship between these two variables.
