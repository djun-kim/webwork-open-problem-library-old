$PAR
Identify the graphs A (blue), B(red) and C (green) as the graphs 
of a function \(f(x)\) and its derivatives \(f'(x)\) and 
\(f''(x)\).
$BR
(Clicking on the sketch will give you a version of the picture in a 
separate window.)
$PAR
\{ans_rule(4)\} is the graph of the function, \(f(x)\) . 
$BR
\{ans_rule(4)\} is the graph of the function's first derivative, 
   \(f'(x)\) . 
$BR
\{ans_rule(4)\} is the graph of the function's second derivative, 
   \(f''(x)\) . 
$PAR
$BBOLD Hint: $EBOLD 
Remember that \(f'(x)\) is itself a function, 
and we can find the derivative of the function \(f'(x)\), 
which is called the second  derivative of the function \(f(x)\) 
and denoted by \(f''(x)\).
