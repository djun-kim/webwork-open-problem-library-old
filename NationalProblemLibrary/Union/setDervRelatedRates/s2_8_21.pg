BEGIN_TEXT
Gravel is being dumped from a conveyor belt at a rate of
$a1 cubic feet per minute. It forms a pile in the shape of a right circular
cone whose base diameter and height are always the same.
$PAR
How fast is the
height of the pile increasing when the pile is $h1 feet high? 
$PAR
\{ans_rule(20) \} ft/min
