BEGIN_TEXT 
Water is leaking out of an inverted conical tank at a rate
of $flowRate cubic meters per min at the same time that water is
being pumped into the tank at a constant rate.  The tank has height
$height meters and the diameter at the top is $diameter meters.  
$PAR
If the water level is rising at a rate of $levelRate meters per
minute when the height of the water is $level meters, find the rate at
which water is being pumped into the tank in cubic meters per
minute.  
$PAR
\{ ans_rule(20) \} cubic m per minute
$PAR
$BBOLD Note:$EBOLD Let R be the unknown rate at which water is being
pumped in.  Then you know that if V is volume of water,
dV/dt = R- $flowRate.  Use similar triangles to
find the relationship between the height of the water and the volume
of the water at any given time.  Recall that the volume of a cone with
base radius r and height h is given by \(\displaystyle\frac{1}{3}\pi
r^2 h\).
