BEGIN_TEXT
The altitude of a triangle is increasing at a rate of $altSpeed
centimeters/minute while the area of the triangle is increasing at a rate
of $areaSpeed square centimeters/minute.  
$PAR
At what rate is the base of the triangle changing when the altitude is 
$alt centimeters and the area is $area square centimeters?
$PAR
\{ ans_rule(30)\} cm/min
$PAR
$BBOLD Note:$EBOLD
The altitude is the height of the triangle in the
formula Area=(1/2)*base*height.  Draw a generic triangle and label the
base as one variable and the altitude (height) as another variable.
You don't need to know how big nor what shape the triangle is to solve
this problem.
