BEGIN_TEXT
A street light is at the top of a $a1 ft tall pole. A woman 6 ft tall
walks away from the pole with a speed of $b1 ft/sec along a straight path.
$PAR
How fast is the tip of her shadow moving when she is $c1 ft from the 
base of the pole? 
$PAR
\{ans_rule(20) \} ft/s
$PAR
$BBOLD Note:$EBOLD Draw a right triangle with the
vertical side representing the pole, and the other end of the
hypotenuse representing the tip of the woman's shadow.  Draw in
the woman, label her distance from the pole as a
variable, and label the distance from the pole to the tip of her
shadow as another variable. Use similar triangles to find a
relationship between these two variables.
