BEGIN_TEXT 
A conical water tank with vertex down has a radius of $tank_radius feet at
the top and is $tank_height feet high.
$PAR
If water flows into the tank at a rate of $flow_rate cubic feet per minute,
how fast is the depth of the water increasing when the water is 
$depth feet deep?
$BR
\{ ans_rule(25)\} ft/min
