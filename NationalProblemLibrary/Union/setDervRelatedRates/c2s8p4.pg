BEGIN_TEXT
When air expands adiabatically (without gaining or losing heat), its
pressure \( P\) and volume \( V \) are related by the equation \(
PV^{1.4}=C \) where \( C \) is a constant.  
$PAR
Suppose that at a certain instant the volume is $vol cubic centimeters
and the pressure is $pressure kPa (kPa = kiloPascals)
and is decreasing at a rate of
$pressureRate kPa/minute.  At what rate in cubic centimeters per
minute is the volume increasing at this instant?
$PAR
\{ ans_rule(30) \} cubic cm per minute
