BEGIN_TEXT
At noon, ship A is $a1 nautical miles due west of ship B.  
Ship A is sailing west at $b1 knots and ship B is sailing north at $c1 knots.
$PAR
How fast (in knots) is the distance between the ships changing at $t1 PM? 
$BR
(Note: 1 knot is a speed of 1 nautical mile per hour.) 
$PAR
\{ans_rule(50) \} knots
$PAR
$BBOLD Note: $EBOLD Draw a diagram showing where the ships are at noon
and where they are ${LQ}some time$RQ later on.  You will need to use
${LQ}distance = velocity * time$RQ to work out how far the ships have
travelled after time t.
