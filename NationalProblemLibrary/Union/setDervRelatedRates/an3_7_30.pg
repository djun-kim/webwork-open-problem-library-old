BEGIN_TEXT 
A boat is pulled into a dock by means of a rope attached to a pulley on the
dock. The rope is attached to the front of the boat, which is $dock_height
feet below the level of the pulley. (There is a diagram of this situation
with problem 30 on p223 of the text.)
$PAR
If the rope is pulled through the pulley at a rate of $rope_rate 
ft/min, at what rate will the boat be approaching the dock when
$rope_length ft of rope is out?
$BR
\{ ans_rule(25)\} ft/s
