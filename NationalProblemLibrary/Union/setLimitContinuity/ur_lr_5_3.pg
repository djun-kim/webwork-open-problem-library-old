BEGIN_TEXT
Let $fstr
$BR
Show that \(f(x)\) has a removable discontinuity at \(x=-$a\) 
and determine what value for \( f(-$a) \) would make \( f(x) \) 
continuous at \( x=-$a \).
$PAR
\(f(-$a)=\)\{ans_rule(15)\} would make \(f(x)\) continuous at \(x=-$a\).
$PAR
Now draw a graph of \(f(x)\). It's just a couple of parabolas!
