BEGIN_TEXT
Let $fstr
$BR
Show that \(f(x)\) has a removable discontinuity at \(x=0\) 
and determine what value for \( f(0) \) would make \(f(x)\) 
continuous at \(x=0\).
$PAR
\(f(0)=\)\{ans_rule(15)\} would make \(f(x)\) continuous at \(x=0\).
$PAR
${BBOLD}Hint:$EBOLD Try combining the fractions and simplifying.
$PAR
The discontinuity at \( x=$a \) is actually ${BBOLD}not$EBOLD a removable 
discontinuity, just in case you were wondering.
