BEGIN_TEXT
A bacteria culture initially contains $a1 bacteria and doubles
every half hour.  The formula for the population is \( p(t)=$a1 e^{kt} \)
for some constant \( k \).  (You will need to find \( k \) to answer the 
following.)
$PAR
Find the size of the bacterial population after $b1 minutes.
