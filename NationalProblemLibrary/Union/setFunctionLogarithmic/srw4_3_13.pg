BEGIN_TEXT
Use the laws of logarithms to rewrite the expression
\[
\ln \sqrt[$a]{x y}
\]
in a form that does not contain any logarithm of a product, quotient or power.
$PAR
After rewriting we have
\[
\ln \sqrt[$a]{x y}= A \log x + B \log y
\]
$BR
with the constant
$BR
\(A=\) \{ans_rule(25) \}
$BR
and the constant
$BR
\(B=\) \{ans_rule(25) \}
