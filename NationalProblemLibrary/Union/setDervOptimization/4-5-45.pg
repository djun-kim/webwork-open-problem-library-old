BEGIN_TEXT
A box is to be made out of a $a by $b piece of cardboard.  Squares
of equal size will be cut out of each corner, and then the ends
and sides will be folded up to form a box with an open top.  Find
the dimensions of the resulting box that has the largest volume.  
$PAR
Enter your result for the dimensions of the bottom of the box
as a comma-separated list; 
for example, if your answer were a box with a base that was 2 by 5, 
you would enter 2, 5 or 5, 2 in the first answer blank.
