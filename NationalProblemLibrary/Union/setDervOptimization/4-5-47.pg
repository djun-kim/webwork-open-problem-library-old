BEGIN_TEXT
A fence is to be built to enclose a rectangular area of $a square
feet.  The fence along three sides is to be made of material that
costs $b dollars per foot, and the material for the fourth side
costs $c dollars per foot.  Find the dimensions of the enclosure 
that is most economical to construct.
$PAR
Enter your result for the dimensions as a comma-separated list; 
for example, if your answer were a rectangle with a length of 2 and 
a width of 5, you would enter 2, 5 or 5, 2 in the first answer blank.
$PAR
Dimensions: \{ans_rule(20)\}
