BEGIN_TEXT
A Union student decided to depart from Earth after
graduation to find work on Mars.  Careful calculations made 
regarding the space shuttle to be built used the following mathematical
model for the velocity (in ft/sec) of the
shuttle from liftoff at \(t = $t0\) seconds until the solid rocket boosters
are jettisoned at \(t = $t1\) seconds:
\[ v(t) = $vstr \]
Using this model, consider the acceleration of the shuttle between liftoff 
and the jettisoning of the boosters.
$BR
The absolute maximum value of the acceleration in this interval
will be \{ans_rule(20)\}$BR
and absolute minimum value of the acceleration in this interval
will be \{ans_rule(20)\}.
