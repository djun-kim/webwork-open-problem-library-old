BEGIN_TEXT

Farmer Jones and his wife, Dr. Jones, decide to build a fence in their
field to keep their sheep safe.  Since Dr. Jones is a mathematician,
she suggests building fences described by \(y = $a x^2\) and
\(y = x^2 + $b\). Farmer Jones thinks is would be easier just to build
an enclosure with straight sides, but he wants to please his wife, so he
follows her suggestion.
$PAR

The area of the enclosed region is \{ans_rule(45)\}.
