# Main text

BEGIN_TEXT

You and your best friend Janine decide to play a game.  You are in a
land of make believe where you are a function, \(f(t)\), and she is a function, \(g(t)\).
The two of you move together throughout this land with you (that is, \(f(t)\) ) controlling your East/West movement and Janine (that is, \(g(t)\) ) controlling your North/South movement.
$PAR
 If your identity, \(f(t)\), is given by

\[f(t) = \frac{(t^2 + $a1)^{\frac{3}{2}}}{3}\]

and Janine's identity, \(g(t)\), is given by

\[g(t) = $a t\]

then how many units of distance do the two of you cover between the
Most Holy Point o' Beginnings, \(t=0\), and The Buck Stops Here, \(t=$b\)?
$PAR

We travel  \{ans_rule(40)\} units of distance.
