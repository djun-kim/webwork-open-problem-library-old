BEGIN_TEXT
The displacement (in meters) of a particle moving in a straight line
is given by \( s = $a1 t^3 \) where \( t \) is measured in seconds.
$PAR
Find the average velocity (include units) of the particle over the 
time interval \( [ $t1 , $t2] \).
$BR
Average velocity = \{ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR
Find the instantaneous velocity (include units) of the particle 
when \( t = $t1 \).
$BR
Instantaneous velocity = \{ans_rule(20)  \}
