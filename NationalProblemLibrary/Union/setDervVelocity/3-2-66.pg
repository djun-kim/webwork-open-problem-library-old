BEGIN_TEXT
An automobile starts from rest and travels down a straight
section of road.  The distance \(s\) (in feet) of the car from the
starting position after \(t\) seconds is given by
\[ s(t) = $a t^3. \]
$BR
(a) Find the instantaneous velocity in feet per second at \(t = $b\) seconds.
$BR
Instantaneous velocity = \{ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR
(b) Find the instantaneous velocity in feet per second at \(t = $c\) seconds.
$BR
Instantaneous velocity = \{ans_rule(20) \}
