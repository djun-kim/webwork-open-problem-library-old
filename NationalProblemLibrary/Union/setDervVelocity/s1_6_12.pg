BEGIN_TEXT
If an arrow is shot straight upward on the moon with a velocity of  $v0  m/s,
its height (in meters) after t seconds is given by
\( s(t) = $v0 t - 0.83 t^2 \).
$PAR
What is the velocity of the arrow in meters per second after $t1 seconds?
$BR
\{ans_rule(25) \}
$PAR
How many seconds will it take for the arrow to return and hit the moon?
$BR
\{ans_rule(25)  \}
$PAR
With what velocity in meters per second will the arrow hit the moon?
