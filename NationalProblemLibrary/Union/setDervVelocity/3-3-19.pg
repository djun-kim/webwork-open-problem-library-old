BEGIN_TEXT
Suppose that an object moves along line 
so that its location is given by \( s(t) = t^2 ? {$a} t\) at time
\(t\).  (Here \(s\) is in meters and \(t\) is in seconds.)
$PAR
(A) Find the average velocity in meters per second for \(t\) changing from $b to $c
seconds.
$BR
Average velocity =  \{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR
(B) Find the instantaneous velocity in meters per second 
at \(t = $d\) seconds.
$BR
Instantaneous velocity =  \{ans_rule(20)\}
