#  Setup

$a = random(10,30,5);
$answer = random(600,1300,10);
$b = $answer*(1-$a/100);

#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
After a $a$PERCENT reduction, you purchase a television for $DOLLAR$b.
What as the television's price before the reduction?
$PAR
a) Write an equation to model the problem.  Let $BITALIC x $EITALIC
represent the price before the reduction.
$BR
Answer: \{ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR
b) Solve the equation to find the price before the reduction. (Note: Your answer should be in the form $BITALIC $DOLLAR$string.$EITALIC)
$BR
Answer: \{ans_rule(20) \}
