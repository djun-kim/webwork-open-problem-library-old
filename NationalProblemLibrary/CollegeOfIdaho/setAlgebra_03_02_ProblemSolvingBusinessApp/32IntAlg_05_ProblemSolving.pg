#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
A company that makes thing-a-ma-bobs has a start up cost of $a_cost.  
It costs the company $b_cost to make each thing-a-ma-bob.  The 
company charges $c_price for each thing-a-ma-bob.  Let
\(x\) denote the number of thing-a-ma-bobs produced.
$PAR
a) Write the cost function, \(C(x)\), for this company.
$BR
Answer:  \{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR      
b) Write the revenue function, \(R(x)\), for this company.
$BR
Answer:  \{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR 
c) What is the minumum number of thing-a-ma-bobs that the company must produce and sell to make a profit? i.e. how many units must be produced and sold for the company to break even. (NOTE: Round your number up.)
$BR
Answer:  \{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR
d) Write the profit function, \(P(x)\), from producing and selling \(x\) thing-a-ma-bobs.
$BR
Answer: \{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR

#  Answer
#  Note:  The equation checker is not too picky.
#         This should be changed to a MathObject format.

$cost = "C(x) = $b x + $a";

#the revenue function
$revenue = "R(x) = $c x";

#determine the minimum number of items for a profit

#the profit function
$profit = "P(x) = ($c-$b) x - $a";
