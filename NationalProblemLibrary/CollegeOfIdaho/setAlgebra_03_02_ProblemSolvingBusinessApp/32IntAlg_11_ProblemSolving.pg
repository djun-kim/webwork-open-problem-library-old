#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
When a small plane flies with the wind, it can travel 
$miles miles in $hrWithWind hours.  When it flies 
against the wind, it takes $hrAgainstWind hours to travel
the same distance.  For the following problems, use \(x\) 
for the rate of the airplane in still air and \(y\) for the 
rate of the wind.
$PAR 
a) Write a mathematical expression for the distance travelled
with the wind.
$BR
Answer:  \{ans_rule(40) \}
$PAR
b) Write a mathematical expression for the distance travelled
against the wind.
$BR
Answer:  \{ans_rule(40) \}
$PAR
c) What is the rate of the $items[$choose]? (Note: The rate is
measured in miles per hour: $BITALIC mph $EITALIC)
$BR
Answer:  \{ans_rule(15) \}

#  Answer
#  Note:  The equation checker is not too picky.
#         This should be changed to a MathObject format.
