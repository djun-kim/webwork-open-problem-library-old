REVIEW: After a $a$PERCENT reduction, you purchase a new computer for $salePrice.
What was the computer's price before the reduction?
$PAR
a) Write an equation to model the problem.  Let $BITALIC x $EITALIC 
represent the price of the computer before the reduction.
$BR
Answer: \{ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR
