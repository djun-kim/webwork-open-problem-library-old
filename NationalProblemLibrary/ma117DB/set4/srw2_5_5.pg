BEGIN_TEXT
The graph of the function 
\( y = - $a f(x) \)
can be obtained from the graph of
\( y = f(x) \)
by one of the following actions:

(a) horizontally stretching the graph of \(f(x)\) by a factor $a;

(b) horizontally shrinking the graph of \(f(x)\) by a factor $a;

(c) vertically stretching the graph of \(f(x)\) by a factor $a;

(d) vertically shrinking the graph of \(f(x)\) by a factor $a;

Your answer is (input a, b, c, or d) \{ans_rule(15) \}

BEGIN_TEXT
Then followed by one of the following actions:

(e) reflecting the resulting graph in \(x\)-axis;

(f) reflecting the resulting graph in \(y\)-axis;

Your answer is (input e or f) \{ans_rule(15) \}
