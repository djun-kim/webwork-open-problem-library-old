BEGIN_TEXT
This problem will help you learn the rules of precedence, i.e. the order in which
mathematical operations are preformed. 
So first let us review the normal way operations are performed.$PAR

The operations are listed here from what is done first to last:  $PAR
First: $BBOLD Paranthesis$EBOLD$BR
Second: $BBOLD Functions$EBOLD$BR
Third: $BBOLD Powers and Roots$EBOLD$BR
Fourth: $BBOLD Multiplicaton and Division$EBOLD$BR
Last: $BBOLD Addition and Subtraction$EBOLD$PAR
For example what is 1+2*3^2? \{ ans_rule(25) \}$PAR
END_TEXT

$ans = 19;
ANS(num_cmp($ans));

BEGIN_TEXT
How do you enter \[ \frac {1+\sin(3)}{2+\tan(4)}? \] Hint: this is a good place to use
paranthesis, [ ]'s, and the $BBOLD Preview Answer$EBOLD button. $BR
\{ ans_rule(25) \}
END_TEXT

$ans = (1+sin(3))/(2+tan(4)) ;
ANS(num_cmp($ans));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
There is one other thing to be careful of.  Multiplication and division have the 
same precedence and there are no universal rules as to which should be done first.
 WeBWorK and most other
computers read things from left to right, i.e. 2/3*4 means (2/3)*4.  If you 
want 2/(3*4) = 2/12, you have to use parentheses.  This is also a case where previewing your answer
can save you a lot a grief since you will be able to see what you entered. 

$BR
Enter 2/3*4 and use the $BBOLD Preview Answer$EBOLD button to see what you get.$BR
\{ ans_rule(25) \}
END_TEXT

$ans = 8/3;
ANS(num_cmp($ans));
