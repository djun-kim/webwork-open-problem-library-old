BEGIN_TEXT
A particle moves along a straight line and its position at time \(t\)
is given by \( s(t)= 2t^3 - $d1 t^2 + $e1 t \) where \(s\) is measured in feet and \(t\) in seconds. 
$BR$BR Find the velocity (in ft/sec) of the particle at time \( t=0 \):
$BR$BR Answer: \{ans_rule(20) \}
$BR
$BR$BR
The particle stops moving (i.e. is in a rest) twice, once when \(t=A\) and again when  \(t=B\) where \( A < B \). Determine \(A\) and \(B\).
$BR$BR
\(A=\) \{ans_rule(20) \}
$BR
\( B=\) \{ans_rule(20) \}
$BR$BR

What is the position of the particle at time \( $c1 \)? $BR
Answer: \{ans_rule(35) \}
$BR
$BR
Finally, what is the $BBOLD total $EBOLD distance the particle travels between time \( 0 \) and time \( $c1 \)? $BR
Answer: \{ans_rule(35) \}
