Consider the function \( f(x) \) whose second derivative is
\( f''(x) = $a1 x + $b1 \sin (x) \). If \( f(0) = $n1\) and
 \( f'(0) = $m1\), what is  \( f(x) \)? $BR$BR

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOF'));
$SOL $BR

To solve this formula we will use the standard rule afor the antiderivatives
of a polynomial and the fact that the antiderivative of \( \sin \) is \( -\cos
\) while the antiderivative of \( \cos \) is \( \sin \).  Furthermore, we will
use the information given to us about \( f'(0) \) and \( f(0) \) to
eliminate any arbitrary constants.
$PAR
Finding the general antiderivative of \( f''(x) \) gives a formula for
\( f'(x) \) as shown below: $BR$BR
\[
  f'(x) = \frac{$a1}{2}x^2 - $b1\cos(x) + C_1
\] $BR$BR
We are told that \( f'(0) = $m1 \) so that we can solve for \( C_1 \) in the
expression above as shown.
\[f'(0) = \frac{$a1}{2}(0)^2 - $b1\cos(x) + C_1 \] $BR
\[    $m1 = -$b1 + C_1 \]
\[    C_1 &= $b2 \]
  $BR$BR
Therefore, the formula for \( f'(x) \) is: $BR$BR
\[
  f'(x) = !{\{$a1/2\}:%5.4f}x^2 - $b1\cos(x) + $b2
\] $BR$BR
Now, we take the antiderivative of \( f'(x) \) to find the general formula
for the function \( f(x) \). $BR$BR
\[
  f(x) = \frac{!{\{$a1/2\}:%5.4f}}{3}x^3 - $b1\sin(x) + {$b2}x + C_2
\] $BR$BR
We are told that \( f(0) = $n1 \) so that we can solve for \( C_2 \) as we
did for \( C_1 \) above. $BR$BR
\[f(0) = \frac{!{\{$a1/2\}:%5.4f}}{3}(0)^3 - $b1\sin(0) + {$b2}(0) + C_2 \\
\[    $n1 = C_2 \] $BR$BR

Therefore, the specific value for the function \( f(x) \) is given by:
$BR$BR
\[
  f(x) = !{$a2:%5.4f}x^3-$b1\sin{x}+{$b2}x+$n1
\]
