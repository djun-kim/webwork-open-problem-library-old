$SOL $BR
To solve this problem, one must remember the relationship between
position at time \( t \) (\( s(t) \)), instantaneous velocity
at time \( t \) (\( v(t) \)), and acceleration at time \( t\) (\(a(t)\)).
This relationship is given by:
$BR$BR
\[  \begin{array}
    v(t)  = s'(t) \\
    a(t)  = v'(t) = s''(t) \\
  \end{array}
\]
$BR$BR
With this in mind, this problem becomes an exercise in finding
antideriviatives.  We should assume that the acceleration due to gravity
is the standard -32 feet per second squared, so that the function \( a(t) = -32 \)
gives acceleration.  Throughout this problem, it is important to remember which 
way is up.  That is, negative values mean the object is accelerating or moving 
down, positive values mean it is accelerating or moving up.  With this in mind,
we need to compute the formula for the velocity of the stone at time \( t \).
$PAR
Since the acceleration function is \( a(t) = -32 \), the velocity function is the
general antiderivative of this, or \( v(t) = -32t + C_1 \) where \( C_1 \) is a
constant.  We are told that he stone is dropped, so its initial speed is 0 feet per 
second.  Therefore, \( v(0) = -32(0) + C_1 = 0 \Rightarrow C_1 = 0 \).  Hence, the
formula for the instantaneous velocity at time \( t \) is \( v(t) = -32t \).
$PAR
Finally, we need to find a formula for the position of the stone at time \( t \).
Taking the antiderivative of the velocity, we get \( s(t) = -16t^2+C_2 \)
where \( C_2 \) is again an unknown constant.  However, this time, we don't yet
have all of the information we need to find \( C_2 \).  So let's back up a 
step and look at our formula for velocity again.
$PAR
Velocity is given by \( v(t) = -32t \).  We are told that the stone strikes the 
ground with a velocity of $v1 feet per second.  Therefore, we can find the exact time
at which the stone strikes the ground by setting \( $v1 = -32t \Rightarrow t = 
!{$t1:%5.3f} \).  This information is what we need to complete the task of
finding a formula for the position of the stone.
$PAR
Since our general antiderivative of velocity gave \( s(t) = -16t^2+C_2 \), 
and we know the stone struck the ground (so its position was 0) at 
\( t = !{$t1:%5.3f} \), we can solve the following equation for \( C_2 \).
$BR$BR
\[
  \begin{array}
    s(!{$t1:%5.3f}) =  0 \\
    -16(!{$t1:%5.3f})^2 + C_2 = 0 \\
    C_2 = !{$ans:%5.3f} \\
  \end{array}
\]
Now, since we want to know the height from which the stone was dropped, we 
just need to find its position at time \( t = 0 \).  But this is \( s(0) = -16(0)^2+ $ans \)
