BEGIN_TEXT
Gravel is being dumped from a conveyor belt at a rate of
\($a1\ \ \textrm{ft}^3/\textrm{min}\). It forms a pile in the shape of a right circular cone whose base diameter and height are always the same.  How fast is the height of the pile increasing when the pile is \($h1\) feet high?

Answer: \{ans_rule(20) \}

HINT(EV3(<<'END_HINT'));

Recall that the volume of a right circular cone with height \(h\) and radius of the base \(r\) is given by \( V= \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2h \)
