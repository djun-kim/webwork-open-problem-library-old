At noon, ship A is $a1 nautical miles due west of ship B.  Ship A is sailing
west at $b1 knots and ship B is sailing north at $c1 knots.
How fast (in knots) is the distance between the ships changing at $t1 PM? (1 knot is a speed of 1 nautical mile per hour.) $BR$BR
Answer: \{ans_rule(50) \}

Note: Draw yourself a diagram which shows where the ships are at noon and where they are "some time" later on.  You will need to use geometry to work out a formula which tells you how far apart the ships are at time \(t\), and you will need to use \(\textrm{distance} = \textrm{velocity} * \textrm{time}\) to work out how far the ships have travelled after time \(t.\)
