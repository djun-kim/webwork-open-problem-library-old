If a ball is thrown straight up into the air with an initial velocity of 
\( $v0 \) ft/s, it height in feet after \( t \) second is given by 
\( y = $v0 t - 16 t^2 \).  $BR$BR$BR

$BBOLD a.) $EBOLD Find the average velocity for the time period begining when \( t = $t0 \) and lasting for the given amount of time.  $BR$BR

$BITALIC (i) $EITALIC \( t= .05 \) seconds. $BR

Answer: \{ans_rule(35) \} $BR$BR

$BITALIC (ii)$EITALIC \( t = 0.1 \) seconds. $BR
Answer: \{ans_rule(35)  \} $BR$BR

$BITALIC (iii) $EITALIC \(t =  0.01 \) seconds. $BR
Answer: \{ans_rule(35)  \} $BR$BR

$BBOLD b.) $EBOLD Based on the above results, guess what the instantaneous
velocity of the ball is when \( t =$t0 \) seconds. $BR
Answer: \{ans_rule(20) \}
