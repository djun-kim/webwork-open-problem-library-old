TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
If \(R\) denotes the reaction of the body to some stimulus of strength
\(x\), the \$BITAL sensitivity $EITAL \(S\) is defined to be the rate of
change of the reaction with respect to \(x\).  A particular example
is that when the brightness \(x\) of a light source is increased, the
eye reacts by decreasing the area \(R\) of the pupil.  The experimental
formula
\[
    R = \frac{$a+$b x^{$c}}{1+$d x^{$c}}
\]
can be used to model the dependence of \(R\) on \(x\) when \(R\)
is measured in square millimeters and \(x\) is measured in
appropriate units of brightness.
