Always a logical person, you conclude that you must have become an Egyptian
pharaoh. You decide to honor yourself with a pyramid of your own design. You
decide it should have height \(h = $h\) and a square base with side \(s = $a \). $BR
To impress your Egyptian subjects, find the volume of the pyramid.$BR

Volume = \{ans_rule(50)\}
