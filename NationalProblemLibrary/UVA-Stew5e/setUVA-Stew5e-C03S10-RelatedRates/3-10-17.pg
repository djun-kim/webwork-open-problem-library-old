Water is leaking out of an inverted conical tank at a rate of \(!{$flowRate:%5.3f}
\)
cubic centimeters per min at the same time that water is being pumped
 into the tank at
a constant rate.  The tank has height \(!{$height:%5.3f}\) meters and the diameter at
the top is \(!{$diameter:%5.3f}\) meters.  If the water level is rising at a rate of
\( !{$levelRate:%5.3f}\) centimeters per minute when the height of the water is
\(! {$level:%5.3f}\) meters,
find the rate at which water is being pumped into the tank in cubic
centimeters per minute.
