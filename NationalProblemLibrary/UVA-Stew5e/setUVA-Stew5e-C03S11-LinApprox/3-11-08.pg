BEGIN_TEXT
Use linear approximation, i.e. the tangent line,  to approximate
\(  \sqrt[3] { $b1 } \) as follows. 
Let \( f(x) = \sqrt[3] x \) and
find the equation of the tangent line to \( f(x) \) at \( x = $a2 \)
in the form \( y = mx+b \).
$BR$BR
$BBOLD Note:$EBOLD The values of \(m\) and \(b\) are rational
numbers which can be computed by hand.  You need to enter expressions
which give \(m\) and \(b\) ${BITALIC} exactly${EITALIC}.  You
may not have a decimal point in the answers to either of these
parts.
$BR$BR
\( m \) = \{ans_rule(30) \}
$BR$BR
\( b \) = \{ans_rule(30) \} 
$BR$BR
Using these values, find the approximation.
$BR$BR \( \sqrt[3] {$b1} \approx \)
\{ans_rule(30) \}
$BR$BR
$BBOLD Note:$EBOLD You can enter decimals for the last part, but
it will has to be entered to very high precision (correct for
6 places past the decimal point).
